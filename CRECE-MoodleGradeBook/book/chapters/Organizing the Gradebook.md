# Organizing the Gradebook

# Using Categories

The Gradebook can be difficult to use due to the amount of information shown
within the table, especially in a course that uses a lot of graded activities. Often,
the main course screen is arranged by topics in order to organize the content, and
we can apply a similar process to the Gradebook through the use of categories to
group grades by topic, assessment type, or any other preferred arrangement.

We have seen how we can carry out course calculations based on how we want
all the assignments to be added together. However, what if you want one set of
assessments to be calculated as a mean of grades and another group of tasks to
show the highest grade? What if you don't want some of the grades to be used
in the calculations? We can use categories in a range of ways in order to group
assessments together, such as by topic or assessment type. We can also use
categories to enable some assessments to have a higher weighting than others.
In this chapter, we will:

- Create categories and learn how to add graded activities to them
- See how categories can provide a range of aggregation types within
  one course
- See ways in which we can exclude grades from the final course total

*Organizing the Gradebook Using Categories*

### Adding categories

Categories enable you to group graded activities within the Gradebook so that they
can be viewed together and provide additional options to calculate final course
grades. We will look at how they can be used throughout this chapter but first, we
need to add some categories. We need to create the categories using the **Grades** area
of the course:

- Go to the **Grades** area and then go to the **Categories and items** screen
  (if using the drop-down list, you will need to choose **Simple view** ).
- At the bottom of the **Categories and items** screen, there is a button that
  says **Add category**. Click on this and a new screen will appear.
- Give the category a name (such as Unit 1). Note that the options you
  get when setting up the category are the same as the options we used in
  *Chapter 5, Using Calculations* to set up how the course should be aggregated.
  This includes the grade display type as well as the aggregation method.
  You can choose the same type of aggregation as the course or use one
  specific aggregation type for this unit.
- In the **Category total** section, you can set a **Maximum grade** option for the
  category. Category totals will work in exactly the same way as the course
  total in order to set a maximum grade available. For example, if Unit 1 has
  three assessments each worth 100 but the maximum for Unit 1 is 100, the
  maximum grade can be set and the aggregation will take this into account
  when presenting a final category total. See the upcoming information box
  for how this affects the course totals.
- Make any further changes you would like to make to the category.
- When you have added at least one category, you get an additional option
  at the bottom of the screen in order to choose a **Parent category** option. This
  allows you to choose whether the category will be a main or a subcategory
  (a subcategory is a category nested within another category). We will look
  at the use of subcategories later in the chapter.
- Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on **Save changes**.

```
When using categories, the course total is calculated using the
category totals instead of the individual assessment grades.
The category will complete the selected aggregation when it
is created and present a category total. The course total will
then use each category total in the aggregation that has been
selected for the course total.
Chapter 6
```

If graded activities have already been added to the course, you can use the **Categories
and items** screen to move graded activities to the relevant categories. Once categories
have been set up, you can choose the relevant category when initially adding the
graded activity to the course.

To move the graded activities into categories, check the small **Select** box next to each
activity that you want to move (the **Select** column is on the right-hand side of the
screen) and at the bottom of the screen, click on **Move selected items to** and choose
the category you would like them to be moved to. You can also use the standard
move icon in the **Actions** column to move individual items as required, as shown:

You can also move the order of the categories after they have been created using the
moving icon:

1. Click on the move icon next the category you want to move (in the **Actions**
   column). This will temporarily remove the category from the screen.
2. White boxes will appear on the screen in all the places where can move the
   category to.
3. Click on the space where you would like the category to be.

*Organizing the Gradebook Using Categories*

In the following screenshot, you can see that there are three categories within the
course and there are two aggregation types used in the course:

For this example, the total of **Unit 1** will be calculated using the 'mean of grades'
aggregation type, which means that the graded items will be divided by 2 (the total
number of graded items in the category).

**Unit 2** will present the sum of grades (in this case, the total of one assignment) as the
category total.

**Unit 3** will also show a sum of grades of the two assignments as the category total.

The course total will be **Sum of grades** (as shown at the top of the preceding
screenshot), which will add together all the grades awarded and shown in the unit
category totals. This calculation will be *Unit 1 + Unit 2 + Unit 3*. Individual assessment
grades will only be included in the final grade if they are not in a category.

```
Chapter 6
```

### Excluding assessments from the final grade

There might be elements of the online course that are assessed but do not count
toward a final grade. These could be formative assessments such as homework
activities, quizzes to enable self-assessment, and so on. These graded items will
automatically appear in the Gradebook, but you might not want the grades to be
counted in the final category or the course total.

There are two main ways in which we can do this. One is to exclude a graded
activity for all students and the other is to exclude individual grades for each
individual student.

#### Excluding assessments from the aggregation for all students

There are a few ways in which this can be achieved. One has already been mentioned
in *Chapter 5* , *Using Calculations* , when using the weighted mean of grades. There are
two further ways in which this can be achieved, and both require the use of categories.

If you would like all the graded items that do not count for the course total to be in
one category, you can do the following:

1. Go to the **Grades** area and then go to the **Categories and items** page
   (if using the drop-down list, choose **Simple view** under the **Categories**
   **and items** heading).
2. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on **Add category**.
3. Give the category a name (such as formative assessments or not used
   for final grade).
4. Make sure the aggregation is not a sum of grades (any other aggregation
   method is fine).
5. Click on **Show more** within the **Category total** section. Find the **Grade type**
   section and choose **None**.
6. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on **Save changes**.

Any graded activities that are listed in this category will not be included in the
course total aggregation.

You can also create the same effect by creating a category with a category total of zero.

*Organizing the Gradebook Using Categories*

If you would like to keep the formative assignment and the summative activities within
the same category rather than keep all the formative work in a separate category, a
subcategory can be used. This enables the graded items to appear together within the
Gradebook, but they are not counted in the course total grade. To achieve this:

1. Go the **Grades** area and then go to the **Categories and items** page.
2. Go to the parent category (where you will be adding the subcategory)
   by clicking on the edit icon next to the category name.
3. Make sure that there is no tick next to **Aggregate including sub-categories**.
   It is worth mentioning here that if you are using subcategories and want the
   grades to be included in the course total, you will need to go into the parent
   category and check this option.
4. Click on **Save changes** at the bottom of the screen.
5. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on **Add category**.
6. Give the category a name (such as formative assessments or not used
   for final grade).
7. Make sure the aggregation is not sum of grades (any other aggregation
   method is fine).
8. Click on **Show more** in the **Category total** section and find the **Grade type**
   section and choose **None**.
9. At the bottom of the screen, click on the drop-down list next to **Parent**
   category, and choose the **Parent** category that you created previously.
10. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on **Save changes**.

Anything moved into this category will not be included in the course aggregation,
but it will enable the assignment to be viewed within the Gradebook with the
relevant parent category.

#### Excluding assessments from the aggregation for individual students

If you only want to exclude some grades for some students, you can do this for each
individual student for each graded activity:

1. Go to the **Grades** area to view **Grader report** (navigate to **Administration** |
   **Grades** ).
2. In the top-right corner, click on **Turn editing on**.

```
Chapter 6
```

1. Once editing is turned on, the edit icon will appear next to each individual
   graded item (it doesn't matter whether the work has been graded yet or not).
2. Click on the edit icon next to the activity that you would like to exclude from
   the aggregation.
3. A screen will appear with an option of **Excluded** as shown in the following
   screenshot. Click on the box next to this option to add a tick to the box.
4. Scroll to the bottom of the screen to click on **Save changes**.

These methods work with all aggregation types except the sum of grades. The sum of
grades will always include all grades in the final aggregation. If you are using **Sum of
grades** , a warning appears next to the **Excluded** option, reminding the user about this:
**excluding of grades is not compatible with sum aggregation**.

### Summary

In this chapter, we saw some ways in which the Gradebook can be organized in order
to make it easier to use through the use of categories. Apart from grouping graded
items together, categories can also be used to further increase the options for grade
calculations by choosing the graded items in a category that will not be included in the
final grade. We also saw how to exclude individual grades from the final course total.

In the next chapters, we will look at how we can use the information in the Gradebook
to report and review students' achievements.

# Reporting with the

# Gradebook

So far, we have seen how we can use number, letter, and scale grades and how we can
add assignments to courses. We can grade assignments and set up the Gradebook to
calculate course totals.

We will now look at how we can view reports for all students as well as for individual
students and some of the other ways in which the grade reports can be customized and
exported. There are four main reports:

- The grader report
- The outcomes report
- The overview report
- The user report

### The grader report

We have already seen the grader report a few times throughout this book, as it is the
main screen we see when we go into the Gradebook.

To get to the grader report, we go to the **Grades** area:

1. Click on **Grades** in the **Administration** block.
2. If you are using the tabs layout, make sure that the **View** tab and **Grader**
   report are selected. If you are using the drop-down list to navigate the
   **Grades** area, ensure that the **Grader report** option under the **View**
   heading is selected.

*Reporting with the Gradebook*

You can see the tabs and the drop-down menu in the following screenshot:

This report shows you the grades of all the students for each graded activity.
This enables the teacher to see the progress of all students in one place.

The report shows you one student per row. For courses with many students, the
student rows might appear over two or more pages. In this case, a **Next** button will
appear to move to the next page of students. However, we can change how many
students are shown per page within the Gradebook preferences. If you have tabs
at the top of your screen, click on **Preferences**. If you're using the drop-down list,
choose **Grader report** under the **Preferences** heading. Within the **General** section,
there is an option to type in how many students per page you would like to view.
Click on **Save changes** to save this option.

Within each column, we can see the grade for each assignment. However, with a lot
of graded activities in the course, the grader report can be very wide. Categories can
be used to organize this content, but the grader report also lets us collapse information
to make it even easier to view.

```
Chapter 7
```

There are three main ways to collapse the information. The following screenshot shows
you two rows of grades (for two different students), and there are three categories set
up for this course ( **Unit 1** , **Unit 2** and **Unit 3** ), as shown in the top row. Each category
is displayed in a different way.

**Unit 1** has a **–** symbol next to it. This is the default way of viewing the category and
grade information, and it shows you the full expanded view of grades. It shows you
each graded activity within the category (in this case, **Task 1** and **Task 2** ) and the
**Category total** column.

**Unit 2** has a **+** symbol next to it. This shows you a collapsed view of the category,
and only shows you the **Category total** column and not the graded activities that
are in that category.

**Unit 3** has a square-based symbol next to it, and this shows you the graded activities
within the category but not the **Category total** column.

You can click on these symbols next to each category to toggle between each view.
The changes are made for the individual user and will be remembered each time
the user views the grader report. You can change the way the report is viewed at
any time.

```
The theme of the Moodle site might show alternative icons
to expand and collapse the category views.
```

A useful option for courses that have a lot of graded activities is to view the **Category
total** column only (so that the **+** symbol is displayed). This will show you all the
category totals in the course so that the grader report is not too detailed. The user can
then choose to view the full content of the category they are using at that point in time
(such as the current unit being delivered).

*Reporting with the Gradebook*

This is particularly useful for courses where different teachers teach different
units, as they can collapse the categories so that they only view the category
that they teach.

Another issue with a course that has a lot of content is related to having a lot of
students in the course. This can make the table very long and can be a particular
issue if there are a number of course groups that use the same online course.
Again, different teachers might grade different groups of students. However,
we can set up groups to enable teachers to only view the students they want.

#### Using groups to further improve the Gradebook's use

Groups are a course-wide feature, but this section will give you a quick overview
of how to set them up and use them within the Gradebook.

There are three elements that we need to address:

- Creating groups and adding students to groups
- Setting the assignments to enable group views
- Changing the course settings to view groups in the Gradebook

##### Creating groups

The following steps shows how to create a group in the Gradebook:

1. Go to the main screen of the course and view the **Administration** block.
   Choose **Users** and click on **Groups**.
2. At the bottom of this screen, click on **Create group**.
3. Type in the name of the group (such as Group A) and click on **Save changes**
   at the bottom of the screen. Repeat this process for each group required.
4. After the groups have been created, they will appear in the groups list on
   the left-hand side of the screen. Click on the first group in the list so that
   it is highlighted and then click on **Add/remove users** in the bottom-right
   corner of the screen.
5. In the right-hand column on the screen, all current members of the course will
   appear. Choose the students who should be part of this group by clicking on
   their name and then clicking on **Add** in the centre of the two columns. Repeat
   this process for each student.

```
Chapter 7
```

1. Once the process is complete, click on **Back to groups** at the bottom of the
   screen. Repeat this process for other groups.

##### Enabling assignments to use groups

Each assignment that we want to be able to grade in groups has to be set up to enable
the use of groups.

This is chosen in the common module settings of the assignment editing screen.
This can be done when we initially set up the assignments:

1. When viewing the assignment on the screen, click on **Edit settings** in the
   **Administration** block.
2. Find the **Common modules settings** section and click on the title to display the
   options. Find the **Group mode** option and change the option from **No groups**
   to **Visible groups** or **Separate groups** and **Save and display** the assignment.

*Reporting with the Gradebook*

1. View the assignment and feedback grading area from within the assignment
   by clicking on the **View/grade all submissions** text.
2. In the top-left section of the assignment area, you will now see a **Visible**
   **groups** or **Separate groups** drop-down list.

You can use this drop-down list to choose the group that you would like to view.
This will filter the students and show only the students in the chosen group. You
can still view all participants to see all the students on the grading screen.

##### Viewing the groups in the Gradebook

If we want to view these groups in the grader report, we need to change the course
settings:

1. From the main course screen, go to the **Administration** block and click on
   **Edit settings** under the **Course administration** heading.
2. Scroll down the page and click on the **Groups** option. Change **Group**
   **mode** to **Visible groups** or **Separate groups**.
3. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on **Save changes**.
4. From the **Administration** block, click on **Grades** to go back to the
   **Grader report**.
5. You will notice that the **Visible groups** or **Separate groups** drop-down
   lists are now available at the top of the grader report. Teachers can filter
   to view groups of students or view all students along with the relevant
   course grades.

Apart from showing assignment grades for each student, the grader report will also
show the outcome grade. However, as the grader report has a lot of information, it can
be difficult for the teacher to see whether each outcome is being achieved throughout
the whole course. The outcomes report provides a summary of the outcomes used in
the course and shows the average outcome grades for the course based on the outcome
grades given to date.

```
Chapter 7
```

### Outcomes report

The outcomes report is used in courses where outcomes have been added to
the course. Details of how to enable and add outcomes are provided in *Chapter 2* ,
*Customizing Grades*. If you have tabs at the top of your screen, click on **View** and
then click on the **Outcomes report** under the tabs. If you're using the drop-down
list, choose **Outcomes report** under the **View** heading.

The outcomes report can help the teacher see which outcomes are being achieved
and at what level; it also helps them see which ones might require additional support
or development.

This previous report lists the three outcomes that have been used within this course.
These are shown in the first column with the **Short name** title.

The second column shows you the average grade for each outcome. This average is
based on the grades awarded for the outcome divided by the number of times this
outcome has been graded. The average is shown in the same scale, as the outcome is
graded but the number in brackets is the equivalent number value. Remember that
the numbers used by scales are based on the number of items in the scale. In this
example, there are three options in the scale ( **Not yet complete** , **Partially complete** ,
and **Complete** ), which means that the maximum number will be three. The average
for **Evidence provided** is **2.17** and therefore, it will display the **Partially complete**
scale value as this is item number two in the scale list.

The **Site-wide** column will state **Yes** or **No** , depending on whether the outcome is
used in this course only (in which case, it will say **No** ) or whether the outcomes are
used throughout the Moodle site (in which case, it will say **Yes** ).

*Reporting with the Gradebook*

The final three columns provide additional details for how the outcomes are used.
The **Activities** column shows you each activity that has this outcome assigned.
The **Average** column will show you the average grade for the task, and the final
**Number of grades** column shows you how many grades this average is based on.

### Overview report

The next report that is available is the overview report. (If you have tabs at the top of
your screen, click on **View** and then click on the **Overview report** under the tabs. If
you're using the drop-down list, choose **Overview report** under the **View** heading.)
This can be accessed from any course, but it enables a teacher to view the current
course totals of each student for all the courses in which they are currently enrolled
on Moodle.

After clicking on **Overview report** , a list of courses will appear, but the first step
is to choose a user or student for whom we want to see the current course results.
This drop-down list appears on the right-hand side next to **Select a user**.

Once a user has been chosen, the course list will change and display all the courses
that the chosen student is enrolled in, and the grade column will show the current
grade awarded for each course.

The current grade shows the same grade that appears in the **Course total** column of
the grader report for each individual course. This grade is likely to change throughout
the duration of the course.

The overview report enables teachers to view students' progress across a number of
Moodle courses without having to visit each course individually. However, the teacher
can choose to review the details of an individual student's progress by clicking on the
**Course name** option in the overview list. This will show you the user report of the
learner for the chosen course.

```
Chapter 7
```

### User report

You can access the user report in the same way as the grader and overview reports.
If you're using the drop-down list, find the **View** heading and click on **User report**.
If you're using the tabs menu, click on **View** , and then click on **User report** , which
is shown under the tabs.

Like the overview report, the user report requires the teacher to choose a user from
the drop-down list on the right-hand side (unless the user report is accessed via the
overview report or by clicking on the grades icon next to the student's name in the
grader report).

The user report will show you each graded activity in the course along with the current
grade awarded for each activity and the feedback given. This has the same information
as the grader report, but this information is for an individual student. It also presents
the information in a portrait rather than landscape format (the following screenshot
only has a few activities within the Gradebook, but for courses with a lot of graded
activities, the page will be longer).

*Reporting with the Gradebook*

The user report shows you each graded activity from the course in the **Grade item**
column with the current **Grade** value awarded next to it. Finally, the **Feedback**
column shows you any written feedback given for the activity. If we click on the
name of the activity, we can access the full assessment information.

The final row of the column shows you the **Course total** grade so far. This is the
same information as what is shown in the **Course total** column in the grader report
and in the overview report. In the previous screenshot, this is **48.11**.

### Reports that students see

A student can access the Gradebook in the same way as a teacher. They will click on
**Grades** in the **Administration** block.

When a student views their grades, it is their own user report that they will see.
Students can also view the overview report. Both reports look the same for the
students as they do for the teacher. However, they can only see their own reports,
whereas a teacher can view the reports for all students in the course.

```
By default, the Gradebook is available for students to view. If you
would like to turn off access to the grades for students, you can do
this in the course settings. Go to the Administration block and click
on Edit settings under the Course Administration heading. Click
on the Appearance title and find the Show gradebook to students
option and change it from Yes to No.
```

### Customizing the reports view

We have seen how the grader, outcomes, overview, and user reports can be used
and the information that can be shown on each. The information shown in the
screenshots used is based on the default settings of each report. However, each
of the reports can also be customized to change the information shown.

Within the **Grades** area of the course, there is a **Settings** section that can be used
to change how each report is viewed in the course.

This is accessed through the **Settings** tab (if using the tabs layout) or by clicking
on the drop-down list. Find the **Settings** heading and click on **Course** (if using the
drop-down list option).

```
Chapter 7
```

A range of options are available for each report type, as shown in the following
screenshot:

*Reporting with the Gradebook*

Change the settings to meet your needs and click on **Save changes** at the bottom of the
screen. These settings will be applied to the course rather than the individual user.

```
Try changing the settings to see how they can customize
your Gradebook and meet your needs.
```

### Exporting the Gradebook data

Apart from viewing the data within Moodle, it is possible to export the Gradebook
data and download it to view and use offline. There are four options that are
available to download it:

- An OpenDocument spreadsheet
- A plain text file
- An Excel spreadsheet
- An XML file

You access these options from the **Grades** area in Moodle in the same way as you
access the reports. How you access the export options will depend on whether you are
using the drop-down menu or tab navigation within the **Grades** area. Both options
are shown in the following screenshot. If you're using the drop-down menu, find the
**Export** heading and click on **OpenDocument spreadsheet** (you can also choose other
export options from here). If you're using the tabs layout, click on the **Export** tab.
Within the export tab, a second row of options appears, which provides you with the
export options.

```
Chapter 7
```

Once you are on the export screen, a range of options are available for you to choose
the information to be exported and downloaded.

*Reporting with the Gradebook*

These options are explained as follows:

- **Include feedback in export** : This includes the written feedback alongside
  the exported data. To include this, we need to click on the box to add a tick.
- **Exclude suspended users** : This is chosen as the default so that only active
  students are in the exported report. However, if you have any users in the
  course who have been assigned as suspended but require the data, we will
  need to remove this tick.
- **Preview rows** : This allows us to choose the number of rows of student data
  that will be shown once the options are submitted. This allows the teacher
  to check the data to ensure that it displays the information required before
  finally exporting the information.
- **Grade export display type** : With this, the teacher can choose whether the
  real, percentage, or letter grade is the grade shown in the exported data
  and how many decimal points are shown with the **Grade export decimal**
  **points** option.
- **Grade items to be included** : With this, the second part of the options will
  display all the graded activities, category totals, and the course totals that
  are included in the online course. The teacher can choose which elements
  they would like in the exported data. For example, a teacher might only
  want to export the data for their own unit. A tick in the box will indicate
  that the data is to be exported. All items will be ticked by default. Clicking
  on the tick will remove the tick and therefore, will not include the data in
  the export.
- Click on **Submit** to start the export process.

After clicking on **Submit** , a preview screen will appear with a **Download** button on it.

The **Download** button will download the chosen Gradebook data in the
selected format.

```
Chapter 7
```

### Summary

In this chapter, we saw the range of ways in which the Gradebook can be used and
customized to display the data required for both teachers and students.

Teachers can see all student grades and individual user data as well as set up groups to
aid the marking and review process. Students and teachers can also see an overview of
all the courses that a user is enrolled on to see the current final grade for each course.

These reports provide the main options to view grades. However, there are a few
further customizations that can aid the progress tracking. The final chapter will
outline some of these options to further enable the tracking of students' progress.

# Additional Features for

# Progress Tracking

The Gradebook is a very useful tool to manage the progress of students. It enables
teachers to review and manage the grades awarded for each graded activity in the
course. However, there are also some other functions within Moodle that enable the
Gradebook to be further enhanced or to track progress outside it. In this chapter we
will do the following:

- Set pass grades to visually show achievement and progression for individual
  pieces of work
- Turn on activity tracking to show progress through activities on the course
- Use course completion to track progress through required elements of
  the course
- Use course and activity completion reports

### Setting pass grades

As we know, we can view the grades awarded in the Gradebook. However, we
can also set pass levels for each graded activity to provide a visual view within the
Gradebook. When pass grades are set, the Gradebook will not only show the grade
but a text color will also be applied. If the grade awarded is below the pass grade,
the text color will be red. If the grade awarded is at or above the pass grade, the
text color will be green.

*Additional Features for Progress Tracking*

This option is set from within the Gradebook and needs to be set for each
individual activity.

1. Go into the Gradebook by clicking on **Grades** in the **Administration** block.
2. Go into the **Simple view** option of the **Categories and items** section of
   the Gradebook.

```
You can also complete these tasks by turning editing on
within the grader report and clicking on the edit icon next
to the graded item.
```

1. Click on the edit icon (a cog in the **Actions** column) next to the graded item
   for which you would like to set the pass grade.
2. Click on **Show more** in the **Grade item** section.
3. You will see the **Maximum grade** option that was set when the activity was
   first created, along with the **Minimum grade** option. Beneath these two
   options there is the **Grade to pass** setting. By default the grade to pass is **0**
   but in the following example the pass grade has been set as **95.00**.
4. Click on **Save changes** at the bottom of the screen.

Once you have saved the grade to pass, return to the **Grader report** option. You will
now notice that the text color changes for any grades that have been awarded for
this assignment.

```
Chapter 8
```

On the following screenshot, the grade for **Task 1** for **Madeline W** is shown in green
which indicates that it is at or above the required pass grade. However, the grade for
**Bayley W** is below the pass grade so the grade is shown in red.

Adding pass grades, where relevant, can help the teacher to quickly see how learners
are progressing while viewing the Gradebook. Setting pass grades can also be useful
in other areas of Moodle to show a quick summary of whether students have passed
or not. For example, setting a pass grade can show whether a task is complete or not
when using the activity completion functions.

### Activity completion

Activity completion in Moodle allows students and teachers to track the use of
resources and activities. This information can be shown to students on the Moodle
screen and in a report for teachers. It can also be used as one of the criteria for
determining course completion status.

Activity completion can be set for any resource or activity within a course. Each
item within the course needs to be set to enable activity completion, so we are able
to choose for some items to be tracked while others are not. For the purpose of this
chapter, we're only going to set assignments to be tracked, but the instructions are
the same for all resources and activities.

In order for activity completion to be used, it needs to be turned on in site
administration and course administration.

```
Site administrators can find the option by navigating to Site
administration | Advanced features and they need to tick
the Enable completion tracking box.
```

*Additional Features for Progress Tracking*

Once **Completion tracking** is turned on for the Moodle site, teachers can turn on
the option within the course by going into the **Administration** block and clicking
on **Edit settings** under the **Course administration** heading. Once in this screen, we
need to scroll down and click on the **Completion tracking** title. Under the **Enable
completion tracking** field, change the option to **Yes** to turn on this option:

Click on **Save changes** at the bottom of the screen. We can now add activity tracking
to any resource or activity within the course. We have already set the option for
a pass grade on an assignment, so we will now also add activity completion to it
to see how this enables us to check progress.

1. View the assignment on the screen and click on **Edit settings** in the
   **Administration** block.
2. Scroll down and click on the **Activity completion** text toward the bottom
   of the page:

```
Chapter 8
```

1. The **Completion tracking** drop-down list will have three options:
   ° **Do not indicate activity completion** : The resource will appear on
   the Moodle course without any activity completion options.
   ° **Students can manually mark as complete** : Students will tick the
   activity to show that they have viewed or completed it. This is often
   a good choice for Moodle resources where you want to track whether
   the student has read the content. For example, the student ticks the
   activity to say they have read it as Moodle can only tell if a student
   has clicked on the link.
   ° **Show activity as complete when conditions are met** : Moodle will
   indicate whether the resource or activity has been completed or not.
   Depending on the type of activity, the options for completion vary.
   This is often the best option to choose for Moodle activities where
   specific tasks need to be completed.
2. Choose **Show activity as complete when conditions are met**.
3. The options below the drop-down list are the different ways in which
   Moodle can decide whether the activity has been completed or not and will
   vary depending on the type of activity. All resources and activities will have
   the **Student must view this activity to complete it** option. However, since an
   assignment is a graded activity, we also get the **Student must receive a grade**
   **to complete this activity** option. Put in a tick in the box to choose this option.
4. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on **Save and return to course**.

Take a look at the course screen and you will now notice a tick box icon on the
right-hand side of the assignment:

The box indicates that the resource has activity completion settings associated with
it, and a tick will appear in the box when the activity is complete. This icon is viewed
by individual students to show their progress through the course.

```
The tick box shown in the previous screenshot has a dotted outline.
This indicates that Moodle will be adding the tick when the activity
is complete. For activities where the student will mark the activity
as complete, this box is shown with a solid line. Students will add a
tick on the box to state that the activity has been completed. A good
tip is to add instructions into the description box when setting up the
activity to tell the students that they will need to click inside the box
to mark the activity as complete.
```

*Additional Features for Progress Tracking*

By default, as soon as the assignment is graded, the activity will be marked as
complete. However, as we have set a grade to pass, the activity will be marked as
complete only when the assignment is graded at or above the required pass grade.

#### Reporting

Let's take a look at how students and teachers view the activity completion
information.

##### The student view

Students view their progress through the main course screen. Next to each item that
has activity completion set up, the student will see a tick once that item has been
completed. In the case of assignments with a pass grade, the student will see a tick
when the assignment has been graded at the pass grade or higher. If the student
does not gain the minimum grade to pass, a cross will appear next to the resource.

The following screenshot shows **Task 1** on the main course screen when **Madeline
W** is logged in:

A green tick is shown next to **Task 1** , which means Madeline has completed this task
and has achieved at least the minimum pass grade. We can also see that **Task 2** is
complete. This is shown with a blue tick and a solid outline on the check box as this
has been marked as complete by the student. **Task 3** , **Task 4** , and **Task 5** are not yet
complete as they do not have any ticks next to them. This means that either Madeline
has not completed the work or the work has not yet been graded.

In the following screenshot, we can see that the course screen of **Bayley W** shows
**Task 1** with a red cross next to it to indicate that the assignment has been graded
but it has not yet met the required pass grade. This shows that the activity is not
yet complete.

The individual course screen and completion status of each activity will vary for
each student. However, the teacher will want to see all of the completion information
on one screen.

##### The teacher view

A teacher can view the students' progress through the **Activity completion** report
which will show the activity completion status for each student of the course for each
activity that has activity completion turned on. To get to this report, we need to use
the **Administration** block and find the **Reports** link:

*Additional Features for Progress Tracking*

The report we need to use is **Activity completion**. After clicking on this option, we
will see a screen similar to the following:

There are many resources within the course but this report will show only those
resources and activities where activity completion has been set. We can see each
student on the course listed on the left-hand side, and the activities that have activity
completion settings added to them will appear across the top of the screen. This table
will show the current completion status for each student and for each activity.

In the previous screenshot, we can see that one student has currently passed **Task
1** and one student has not yet passed. If the assignment had not yet been submitted
for any student or it hadn't been graded, there would be no color icon in the activity
column as shown for **Bayley W** for **Task 2**. Cross icons appear only when grades to
pass have been set and the student has not achieved the required grade.

This activity report enables the teacher to very quickly see progress on required
items in the course. When used with the **Grade to pass** option, the teacher can very
easily view how individual students are progressing in a simple format. It does not,
however, provide the specific grade for each assignment, so it does not completely
replace the Gradebook. We can click on the activity name in the top row and this
will take us to the activity (and give access to the grades) if required. However, in
courses where students only need to complete and pass specific activities, the activity
completion report could be used instead of the Gradebook for progress tracking.

You will notice that it is possible to choose letters for **First name** and **Surname** to
filter the group to see specific students. If you have set up groups in the course as
explained in *Chapter 7* , *Reporting with the Gradebook* , the list of groups will also appear
in this activity completion report to filter groups of students. You can also download
this data in a spreadsheet for further use and manipulation.

```
Chapter 8
```

If courses have lots of resources with activity completion added, this report can be
quite big. However, it is possible to further select activities for reporting through the
use of course completion.

### Course completion

Course completion enables the teacher to set the required elements that must be
completed in order to achieve the course. This can be used in the same way as
activity completion, and it can also be used to complement it.

For example, an online course can contain a wide range of resources and activities
that could be a mixture of required elements alongside further supplementary
resources. However, some of these activities, such as the assessed elements, might
need to be tracked separately by the teacher and looking through the whole activity
report could be quite time consuming. This is where course completion can be used.

Within the course, where course completion is to be added, click on the
**Administration** block and click on **Course Completion** :

```
This needs to be enabled within the course first as explained in
the Activity tracking section of this chapter.
```

*Additional Features for Progress Tracking*

We have a number of options within the **Completion completion** screen. We can
enable one or many options and choose whether all of these options are required
or the course will be complete if any one of them has been achieved. These options
are as follows:

- **General** : This is where we can choose whether all the options that we set are
  required or if any of them can be completed (in which case, as long as one of
  them is completed, the student will complete the course).
- **Condition: Activity completion** : All resources and activities that have
  activity completion added to them will appear in a list here with a checkbox
  next to them. It is here that we will choose the required elements that need to
  be achieved in order to complete the course. For our example, there is a list
  of all the assignments within the course. Put a tick next to each assignment
  in your course. At the bottom of the list, there is also an option for you to
  choose whether students need to complete all or any of these activities.
  You can see these options in the following screenshot:
- **Condition: Completion of other courses** : If other courses on the site
  have course completion set up, we can choose other courses that need to be
  completed before this course can be marked as complete. Students can work
  on the online courses concurrently but the course where this setting is enabled
  will not be marked as complete until the chosen prerequisite courses are also
  marked as complete. We also get an "any or all" option again.

- **Condition: Date** : If this option is enabled students will not be able to
  complete the course until at least the date set.
- **Condition: Enrolment duration** : This is similar to the date option but instead
  of specifying a date, we can choose a length of time that the student needs to
  be enrolled on the course. If enabled, students will not be able to complete
  the course until at least the specified number of days from which they
  became members of the online course.
- **Condition: Unenrolment** : This will mark the course as complete when a
  student is unenrolled from the course.
- **Condition: Course Grade** : If enabled, a course pass grade can be set. Once
  the Gradebook course total meets this grade for a student, this element will
  be marked as complete on the course completion report.
- **Manual self completion** : If this option is enabled, students will be able
  to indicate that they have completed the course. If we use this option, the
  self-completion block must also be added to the course to give students
  the option to choose **Complete course**.
- **Manual completion by** : This can be used as a final checking procedure. If a
  role is chosen here, any user with that role will need to check all the activities
  and manually confirm that the work is completed. This is very useful where
  additional paperwork or checking is required. We also get an "any or all"
  option here to choose whether multiple roles need to sign off the completion
  or only one is required. For our example, choose **Teacher**.
- Click on **Save changes**.

#### Reporting

It is possible to access the course completion report through the **Reports** option
within the **Administration** menu in the same way as the activity completion
report. However, there is also a block available to further enhance the use of
course completion.

To add the block, do the following steps:

1. Click on **Turn editing on**.
2. Find the **Add a block** option (usually at the bottom of all the existing blocks
   on the left-hand side of the course) and click on **Add**.
3. Choose **Course completion status**.

*Additional Features for Progress Tracking*

##### The teacher view

The block will look like this to the teacher:

Click on **View course report**. You will see a report similar to the activity completion
report but it will only show the options, resources, and activities that were chosen in
the course completion setup process:

The report shows ticks for **Activities** that have been completed successfully or
crosses where a student has not yet met the specific requirements for the activity and
has not been awarded the required pass grade (when a **Grade to pass** has been set).
There will be no icon shown for the activities that are not yet complete. Note that
under the **Activities** title it says **All** indicating that all the activities are required.

```
Chapter 8
```

Under the **Approval** heading, there is a **Teacher** column. This is used by the teacher
to manually tick when they are satisfied that all the required elements have been
completed. If no role is set up for manual completion, this column will not be in the
course report. If multiple roles had been set up, they would all appear here. Notice
again that it shows the **All the approval roles are required** message. In this case,
only one is required.

If self-completion has been turned on, this will also be shown here.

Finally, the **Course** heading has a **Course complete** column. When all the required
elements have a tick within them, a tick will automatically appear in this column.

If any course prerequisites or course grades have been set in the Completion completion screen, these elements will be shown in the report.



As with the activity completion report, you can view specific students, download the report, and use groups on this screen. 

##### The student view

A student will see a different version of this report and, of course, it will only show
them their own data. Let's take a look at what Madeline W would see.

On the main screen of the course, Madeline sees a summary of her progress to date
in the **Course completion** status block:

*Additional Features for Progress Tracking*

Madeline can see that the course is currently in progress and that two out of the five
required activities are complete. Madeline can get further information by clicking on
**More details**. This will show the following window:

This provides further information about the activities that need to be completed and
the current status of each item required. If the activities are complete, the completion
date is shown.

If self-completion is enabled for the course, students will also see a **Self completion**
option within this report. When using this option, the **Self completion** block must
also be added to the course. This block contains a link that says **Complete course**.
This is clicked when the student is ready to complete the course (that is, when they
feel that everything is finished and complete):

After clicking on the **Complete course** text, the student will be asked to confirm by
clicking on **Yes** or **No** :

Please note that students can click on this even if the required course activities are
not yet complete.

The activity and course completion reports are updated when the cron job is completed on the server. This captures the most up-to-date information in relation to Moodle activities to ensure the reports are up to date. If the reports need to be constantly up to date, the cron job might need to be set up to run regularly. Speak with your Moodle administrator to find out more about the cron job.

### Summary

The **Moodle Gradebook** may be as complex as student evaluation can be. They can also be used to show view of the elements that the student has achieved to date. Some characteristics we have discussed in this trainingmaterial have been:

- Election of resources and activities that are able to be reported on the Gradebook.
- Monitoring of activities completion.
- A deep look to the Gradebook key features.
- The default settings.
- _Gradebook Settings_ customization both, at course or teacher levels and those depending on the site administrator.
- 

Through the use of numerical grades, letter grades, and scales, a teacher can customize
their Gradebook to ensure that it can meet the specific course requirements. Where
required, a teacher can also make use of outcomes that can be used in conjunction with
a scale to demonstrate competency against specific criteria. Each type of grade has its
own benefits, but the options you would like to calculate the final grade should be
considered before you choose your grade type in order to ensure that it meets your
needs. Remember that numerical grades or grade letters can always be calculated in
a more straightforward manner than word grades (scales). Scales should only be used
when no grading or only simple grading is required. However, numerical grades and
letter grades can be used for more complex grading requirements.

We will now take a look at how to add these grading options to assignments within
Moodle before you learn how to grade work.

### Summary 3

In this chapter, we added a range of assignments that made use of number and scale
grades as well as added outcomes to an assignment. We also added two assignments
using the advanced grading methods that will enable us to grade assignments using
specific criteria. Finally, we added a graded item directly into the Gradebook.

In the next chapter, we will look at grading assessments. We will add number and scale
grades, add written feedback, grade outcomes, and make use of the marking guides
and rubrics we created. We will also review the options within the marking workflow,
use the offline grading worksheet, and grade work directly w
