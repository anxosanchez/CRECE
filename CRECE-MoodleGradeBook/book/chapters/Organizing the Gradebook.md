# Organizing the Gradebook

# Using Categories

The Gradebook can be difficult to use due to the amount of information shown
within the table, especially in a course that uses a lot of graded activities. Often,
the main course screen is arranged by topics in order to organize the content, and
we can apply a similar process to the Gradebook through the use of categories to
group grades by topic, assessment type, or any other preferred arrangement.

We have seen how we can carry out course calculations based on how we want
all the assignments to be added together. However, what if you want one set of
assessments to be calculated as a mean of grades and another group of tasks to
show the highest grade? What if you don't want some of the grades to be used
in the calculations? We can use categories in a range of ways in order to group
assessments together, such as by topic or assessment type. We can also use
categories to enable some assessments to have a higher weighting than others.
In this chapter, we will:

- Create categories and learn how to add graded activities to them
- See how categories can provide a range of aggregation types within
  one course
- See ways in which we can exclude grades from the final course total

*Organizing the Gradebook Using Categories*

### Adding categories

Categories enable you to group graded activities within the Gradebook so that they
can be viewed together and provide additional options to calculate final course
grades. We will look at how they can be used throughout this chapter but first, we
need to add some categories. We need to create the categories using the **Grades** area
of the course:

- Go to the **Grades** area and then go to the **Categories and items** screen
  (if using the drop-down list, you will need to choose **Simple view** ).
- At the bottom of the **Categories and items** screen, there is a button that
  says **Add category**. Click on this and a new screen will appear.
- Give the category a name (such as Unit 1). Note that the options you
  get when setting up the category are the same as the options we used in
  *Chapter 5, Using Calculations* to set up how the course should be aggregated.
  This includes the grade display type as well as the aggregation method.
  You can choose the same type of aggregation as the course or use one
  specific aggregation type for this unit.
- In the **Category total** section, you can set a **Maximum grade** option for the
  category. Category totals will work in exactly the same way as the course
  total in order to set a maximum grade available. For example, if Unit 1 has
  three assessments each worth 100 but the maximum for Unit 1 is 100, the
  maximum grade can be set and the aggregation will take this into account
  when presenting a final category total. See the upcoming information box
  for how this affects the course totals.
- Make any further changes you would like to make to the category.
- When you have added at least one category, you get an additional option
  at the bottom of the screen in order to choose a **Parent category** option. This
  allows you to choose whether the category will be a main or a subcategory
  (a subcategory is a category nested within another category). We will look
  at the use of subcategories later in the chapter.
- Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on **Save changes**.

```
When using categories, the course total is calculated using the
category totals instead of the individual assessment grades.
The category will complete the selected aggregation when it
is created and present a category total. The course total will
then use each category total in the aggregation that has been
selected for the course total.
Chapter 6
```

If graded activities have already been added to the course, you can use the **Categories
and items** screen to move graded activities to the relevant categories. Once categories
have been set up, you can choose the relevant category when initially adding the
graded activity to the course.

To move the graded activities into categories, check the small **Select** box next to each
activity that you want to move (the **Select** column is on the right-hand side of the
screen) and at the bottom of the screen, click on **Move selected items to** and choose
the category you would like them to be moved to. You can also use the standard
move icon in the **Actions** column to move individual items as required, as shown:

You can also move the order of the categories after they have been created using the
moving icon:

1. Click on the move icon next the category you want to move (in the **Actions**
   column). This will temporarily remove the category from the screen.
2. White boxes will appear on the screen in all the places where can move the
   category to.
3. Click on the space where you would like the category to be.

*Organizing the Gradebook Using Categories*

In the following screenshot, you can see that there are three categories within the
course and there are two aggregation types used in the course:

For this example, the total of **Unit 1** will be calculated using the 'mean of grades'
aggregation type, which means that the graded items will be divided by 2 (the total
number of graded items in the category).

**Unit 2** will present the sum of grades (in this case, the total of one assignment) as the
category total.

**Unit 3** will also show a sum of grades of the two assignments as the category total.

The course total will be **Sum of grades** (as shown at the top of the preceding
screenshot), which will add together all the grades awarded and shown in the unit
category totals. This calculation will be *Unit 1 + Unit 2 + Unit 3*. Individual assessment
grades will only be included in the final grade if they are not in a category.

```
Chapter 6
```

### Excluding assessments from the final grade

There might be elements of the online course that are assessed but do not count
toward a final grade. These could be formative assessments such as homework
activities, quizzes to enable self-assessment, and so on. These graded items will
automatically appear in the Gradebook, but you might not want the grades to be
counted in the final category or the course total.

There are two main ways in which we can do this. One is to exclude a graded
activity for all students and the other is to exclude individual grades for each
individual student.

#### Excluding assessments from the aggregation for all students

There are a few ways in which this can be achieved. One has already been mentioned
in *Chapter 5* , *Using Calculations* , when using the weighted mean of grades. There are
two further ways in which this can be achieved, and both require the use of categories.

If you would like all the graded items that do not count for the course total to be in
one category, you can do the following:

1. Go to the **Grades** area and then go to the **Categories and items** page
   (if using the drop-down list, choose **Simple view** under the **Categories**
   **and items** heading).
2. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on **Add category**.
3. Give the category a name (such as formative assessments or not used
   for final grade).
4. Make sure the aggregation is not a sum of grades (any other aggregation
   method is fine).
5. Click on **Show more** within the **Category total** section. Find the **Grade type**
   section and choose **None**.
6. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on **Save changes**.

Any graded activities that are listed in this category will not be included in the
course total aggregation.

You can also create the same effect by creating a category with a category total of zero.

*Organizing the Gradebook Using Categories*

If you would like to keep the formative assignment and the summative activities within
the same category rather than keep all the formative work in a separate category, a
subcategory can be used. This enables the graded items to appear together within the
Gradebook, but they are not counted in the course total grade. To achieve this:

1. Go the **Grades** area and then go to the **Categories and items** page.
2. Go to the parent category (where you will be adding the subcategory)
   by clicking on the edit icon next to the category name.
3. Make sure that there is no tick next to **Aggregate including sub-categories**.
   It is worth mentioning here that if you are using subcategories and want the
   grades to be included in the course total, you will need to go into the parent
   category and check this option.
4. Click on **Save changes** at the bottom of the screen.
5. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on **Add category**.
6. Give the category a name (such as formative assessments or not used
   for final grade).
7. Make sure the aggregation is not sum of grades (any other aggregation
   method is fine).
8. Click on **Show more** in the **Category total** section and find the **Grade type**
   section and choose **None**.
9. At the bottom of the screen, click on the drop-down list next to **Parent**
   category, and choose the **Parent** category that you created previously.
10. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on **Save changes**.

Anything moved into this category will not be included in the course aggregation,
but it will enable the assignment to be viewed within the Gradebook with the
relevant parent category.

#### Excluding assessments from the aggregation for individual students

If you only want to exclude some grades for some students, you can do this for each
individual student for each graded activity:

1. Go to the **Grades** area to view **Grader report** (navigate to **Administration** |
   **Grades** ).
2. In the top-right corner, click on **Turn editing on**.

```
Chapter 6
```

1. Once editing is turned on, the edit icon will appear next to each individual
   graded item (it doesn't matter whether the work has been graded yet or not).
2. Click on the edit icon next to the activity that you would like to exclude from
   the aggregation.
3. A screen will appear with an option of **Excluded** as shown in the following
   screenshot. Click on the box next to this option to add a tick to the box.
4. Scroll to the bottom of the screen to click on **Save changes**.

These methods work with all aggregation types except the sum of grades. The sum of
grades will always include all grades in the final aggregation. If you are using **Sum of
grades** , a warning appears next to the **Excluded** option, reminding the user about this:
**excluding of grades is not compatible with sum aggregation**.

### Summary

In this chapter, we saw some ways in which the Gradebook can be organized in order
to make it easier to use through the use of categories. Apart from grouping graded
items together, categories can also be used to further increase the options for grade
calculations by choosing the graded items in a category that will not be included in the
final grade. We also saw how to exclude individual grades from the final course total.

In the next chapters, we will look at how we can use the information in the Gradebook
to report and review students' achievements.

# 

# Progress Tracking

The Gradebook is a very useful tool to manage the progress of students. It enables
teachers to review and manage the grades awarded for each graded activity in the
course. However, there are also some other functions within Moodle that enable the
Gradebook to be further enhanced or to track progress outside it. In this chapter we
will do the following:

- Set pass grades to visually show achievement and progression for individual
  pieces of work
- Turn on activity tracking to show progress through activities on the course
- Use course completion to track progress through required elements of
  the course
- Use course and activity completion reports

### Setting pass grades

As we know, we can view the grades awarded in the Gradebook. However, we
can also set pass levels for each graded activity to provide a visual view within the
Gradebook. When pass grades are set, the Gradebook will not only show the grade
but a text color will also be applied. If the grade awarded is below the pass grade,
the text color will be red. If the grade awarded is at or above the pass grade, the
text color will be green.

*Additional Features for Progress Tracking*

This option is set from within the Gradebook and needs to be set for each
individual activity.

1. Go into the Gradebook by clicking on **Grades** in the **Administration** block.
2. Go into the **Simple view** option of the **Categories and items** section of
   the Gradebook.

```
You can also complete these tasks by turning editing on
within the grader report and clicking on the edit icon next
to the graded item.
```

1. Click on the edit icon (a cog in the **Actions** column) next to the graded item
   for which you would like to set the pass grade.
2. Click on **Show more** in the **Grade item** section.
3. You will see the **Maximum grade** option that was set when the activity was
   first created, along with the **Minimum grade** option. Beneath these two
   options there is the **Grade to pass** setting. By default the grade to pass is **0**
   but in the following example the pass grade has been set as **95.00**.
4. Click on **Save changes** at the bottom of the screen.

Once you have saved the grade to pass, return to the **Grader report** option. You will
now notice that the text color changes for any grades that have been awarded for
this assignment.

```
Chapter 8
```

On the following screenshot, the grade for **Task 1** for **Madeline W** is shown in green
which indicates that it is at or above the required pass grade. However, the grade for
**Bayley W** is below the pass grade so the grade is shown in red.

Adding pass grades, where relevant, can help the teacher to quickly see how learners
are progressing while viewing the Gradebook. Setting pass grades can also be useful
in other areas of Moodle to show a quick summary of whether students have passed
or not. For example, setting a pass grade can show whether a task is complete or not
when using the activity completion functions.

### Activity completion

Activity completion in Moodle allows students and teachers to track the use of
resources and activities. This information can be shown to students on the Moodle
screen and in a report for teachers. It can also be used as one of the criteria for
determining course completion status.

Activity completion can be set for any resource or activity within a course. Each
item within the course needs to be set to enable activity completion, so we are able
to choose for some items to be tracked while others are not. For the purpose of this
chapter, we're only going to set assignments to be tracked, but the instructions are
the same for all resources and activities.

In order for activity completion to be used, it needs to be turned on in site
administration and course administration.

```
Site administrators can find the option by navigating to Site
administration | Advanced features and they need to tick
the Enable completion tracking box.
```

*Additional Features for Progress Tracking*

Once **Completion tracking** is turned on for the Moodle site, teachers can turn on
the option within the course by going into the **Administration** block and clicking
on **Edit settings** under the **Course administration** heading. Once in this screen, we
need to scroll down and click on the **Completion tracking** title. Under the **Enable
completion tracking** field, change the option to **Yes** to turn on this option:

Click on **Save changes** at the bottom of the screen. We can now add activity tracking
to any resource or activity within the course. We have already set the option for
a pass grade on an assignment, so we will now also add activity completion to it
to see how this enables us to check progress.

1. View the assignment on the screen and click on **Edit settings** in the
   **Administration** block.
2. Scroll down and click on the **Activity completion** text toward the bottom
   of the page:

```
Chapter 8
```

1. The **Completion tracking** drop-down list will have three options:
   ° **Do not indicate activity completion** : The resource will appear on
   the Moodle course without any activity completion options.
   ° **Students can manually mark as complete** : Students will tick the
   activity to show that they have viewed or completed it. This is often
   a good choice for Moodle resources where you want to track whether
   the student has read the content. For example, the student ticks the
   activity to say they have read it as Moodle can only tell if a student
   has clicked on the link.
   ° **Show activity as complete when conditions are met** : Moodle will
   indicate whether the resource or activity has been completed or not.
   Depending on the type of activity, the options for completion vary.
   This is often the best option to choose for Moodle activities where
   specific tasks need to be completed.
2. Choose **Show activity as complete when conditions are met**.
3. The options below the drop-down list are the different ways in which
   Moodle can decide whether the activity has been completed or not and will
   vary depending on the type of activity. All resources and activities will have
   the **Student must view this activity to complete it** option. However, since an
   assignment is a graded activity, we also get the **Student must receive a grade**
   **to complete this activity** option. Put in a tick in the box to choose this option.
4. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on **Save and return to course**.

Take a look at the course screen and you will now notice a tick box icon on the
right-hand side of the assignment:

The box indicates that the resource has activity completion settings associated with
it, and a tick will appear in the box when the activity is complete. This icon is viewed
by individual students to show their progress through the course.

```
The tick box shown in the previous screenshot has a dotted outline.
This indicates that Moodle will be adding the tick when the activity
is complete. For activities where the student will mark the activity
as complete, this box is shown with a solid line. Students will add a
tick on the box to state that the activity has been completed. A good
tip is to add instructions into the description box when setting up the
activity to tell the students that they will need to click inside the box
to mark the activity as complete.
```

*Additional Features for Progress Tracking*

By default, as soon as the assignment is graded, the activity will be marked as
complete. However, as we have set a grade to pass, the activity will be marked as
complete only when the assignment is graded at or above the required pass grade.

#### Reporting

Let's take a look at how students and teachers view the activity completion
information.

##### The student view

Students view their progress through the main course screen. Next to each item that
has activity completion set up, the student will see a tick once that item has been
completed. In the case of assignments with a pass grade, the student will see a tick
when the assignment has been graded at the pass grade or higher. If the student
does not gain the minimum grade to pass, a cross will appear next to the resource.

The following screenshot shows **Task 1** on the main course screen when **Madeline
W** is logged in:

A green tick is shown next to **Task 1** , which means Madeline has completed this task
and has achieved at least the minimum pass grade. We can also see that **Task 2** is
complete. This is shown with a blue tick and a solid outline on the check box as this
has been marked as complete by the student. **Task 3** , **Task 4** , and **Task 5** are not yet
complete as they do not have any ticks next to them. This means that either Madeline
has not completed the work or the work has not yet been graded.

In the following screenshot, we can see that the course screen of **Bayley W** shows
**Task 1** with a red cross next to it to indicate that the assignment has been graded
but it has not yet met the required pass grade. This shows that the activity is not
yet complete.

The individual course screen and completion status of each activity will vary for
each student. However, the teacher will want to see all of the completion information
on one screen.

##### The teacher view

A teacher can view the students' progress through the **Activity completion** report
which will show the activity completion status for each student of the course for each
activity that has activity completion turned on. To get to this report, we need to use
the **Administration** block and find the **Reports** link:

*Additional Features for Progress Tracking*

The report we need to use is **Activity completion**. After clicking on this option, we
will see a screen similar to the following:

There are many resources within the course but this report will show only those
resources and activities where activity completion has been set. We can see each
student on the course listed on the left-hand side, and the activities that have activity
completion settings added to them will appear across the top of the screen. This table
will show the current completion status for each student and for each activity.

In the previous screenshot, we can see that one student has currently passed **Task
1** and one student has not yet passed. If the assignment had not yet been submitted
for any student or it hadn't been graded, there would be no color icon in the activity
column as shown for **Bayley W** for **Task 2**. Cross icons appear only when grades to
pass have been set and the student has not achieved the required grade.

This activity report enables the teacher to very quickly see progress on required
items in the course. When used with the **Grade to pass** option, the teacher can very
easily view how individual students are progressing in a simple format. It does not,
however, provide the specific grade for each assignment, so it does not completely
replace the Gradebook. We can click on the activity name in the top row and this
will take us to the activity (and give access to the grades) if required. However, in
courses where students only need to complete and pass specific activities, the activity
completion report could be used instead of the Gradebook for progress tracking.

You will notice that it is possible to choose letters for **First name** and **Surname** to
filter the group to see specific students. If you have set up groups in the course as
explained in *Chapter 7* , *Reporting with the Gradebook* , the list of groups will also appear
in this activity completion report to filter groups of students. You can also download
this data in a spreadsheet for further use and manipulation.

```
Chapter 8
```

If courses have lots of resources with activity completion added, this report can be
quite big. However, it is possible to further select activities for reporting through the
use of course completion.

### Course completion

Course completion enables the teacher to set the required elements that must be
completed in order to achieve the course. This can be used in the same way as
activity completion, and it can also be used to complement it.

For example, an online course can contain a wide range of resources and activities
that could be a mixture of required elements alongside further supplementary
resources. However, some of these activities, such as the assessed elements, might
need to be tracked separately by the teacher and looking through the whole activity
report could be quite time consuming. This is where course completion can be used.

Within the course, where course completion is to be added, click on the
**Administration** block and click on **Course Completion** :

```
This needs to be enabled within the course first as explained in
the Activity tracking section of this chapter.
```

*Additional Features for Progress Tracking*

We have a number of options within the **Completion completion** screen. We can
enable one or many options and choose whether all of these options are required
or the course will be complete if any one of them has been achieved. These options
are as follows:

- **General** : This is where we can choose whether all the options that we set are
  required or if any of them can be completed (in which case, as long as one of
  them is completed, the student will complete the course).
- **Condition: Activity completion** : All resources and activities that have
  activity completion added to them will appear in a list here with a checkbox
  next to them. It is here that we will choose the required elements that need to
  be achieved in order to complete the course. For our example, there is a list
  of all the assignments within the course. Put a tick next to each assignment
  in your course. At the bottom of the list, there is also an option for you to
  choose whether students need to complete all or any of these activities.
  You can see these options in the following screenshot:
- **Condition: Completion of other courses** : If other courses on the site
  have course completion set up, we can choose other courses that need to be
  completed before this course can be marked as complete. Students can work
  on the online courses concurrently but the course where this setting is enabled
  will not be marked as complete until the chosen prerequisite courses are also
  marked as complete. We also get an "any or all" option again.

- **Condition: Date** : If this option is enabled students will not be able to
  complete the course until at least the date set.
- **Condition: Enrolment duration** : This is similar to the date option but instead
  of specifying a date, we can choose a length of time that the student needs to
  be enrolled on the course. If enabled, students will not be able to complete
  the course until at least the specified number of days from which they
  became members of the online course.
- **Condition: Unenrolment** : This will mark the course as complete when a
  student is unenrolled from the course.
- **Condition: Course Grade** : If enabled, a course pass grade can be set. Once
  the Gradebook course total meets this grade for a student, this element will
  be marked as complete on the course completion report.
- **Manual self completion** : If this option is enabled, students will be able
  to indicate that they have completed the course. If we use this option, the
  self-completion block must also be added to the course to give students
  the option to choose **Complete course**.
- **Manual completion by** : This can be used as a final checking procedure. If a
  role is chosen here, any user with that role will need to check all the activities
  and manually confirm that the work is completed. This is very useful where
  additional paperwork or checking is required. We also get an "any or all"
  option here to choose whether multiple roles need to sign off the completion
  or only one is required. For our example, choose **Teacher**.
- Click on **Save changes**.

#### Reporting

It is possible to access the course completion report through the **Reports** option
within the **Administration** menu in the same way as the activity completion
report. However, there is also a block available to further enhance the use of
course completion.

To add the block, do the following steps:

1. Click on **Turn editing on**.
2. Find the **Add a block** option (usually at the bottom of all the existing blocks
   on the left-hand side of the course) and click on **Add**.
3. Choose **Course completion status**.

*Additional Features for Progress Tracking*

##### The teacher view

The block will look like this to the teacher:

Click on **View course report**. You will see a report similar to the activity completion
report but it will only show the options, resources, and activities that were chosen in
the course completion setup process:

The report shows ticks for **Activities** that have been completed successfully or
crosses where a student has not yet met the specific requirements for the activity and
has not been awarded the required pass grade (when a **Grade to pass** has been set).
There will be no icon shown for the activities that are not yet complete. Note that
under the **Activities** title it says **All** indicating that all the activities are required.

```
Chapter 8
```

Under the **Approval** heading, there is a **Teacher** column. This is used by the teacher
to manually tick when they are satisfied that all the required elements have been
completed. If no role is set up for manual completion, this column will not be in the
course report. If multiple roles had been set up, they would all appear here. Notice
again that it shows the **All the approval roles are required** message. In this case,
only one is required.

If self-completion has been turned on, this will also be shown here.

Finally, the **Course** heading has a **Course complete** column. When all the required
elements have a tick within them, a tick will automatically appear in this column.

If any course prerequisites or course grades have been set in the Completion completion screen, these elements will be shown in the report.



As with the activity completion report, you can view specific students, download the report, and use groups on this screen. 

##### The student view

A student will see a different version of this report and, of course, it will only show
them their own data. Let's take a look at what Madeline W would see.

On the main screen of the course, Madeline sees a summary of her progress to date
in the **Course completion** status block:

*Additional Features for Progress Tracking*

Madeline can see that the course is currently in progress and that two out of the five
required activities are complete. Madeline can get further information by clicking on
**More details**. This will show the following window:

This provides further information about the activities that need to be completed and
the current status of each item required. If the activities are complete, the completion
date is shown.

If self-completion is enabled for the course, students will also see a **Self completion**
option within this report. When using this option, the **Self completion** block must
also be added to the course. This block contains a link that says **Complete course**.
This is clicked when the student is ready to complete the course (that is, when they
feel that everything is finished and complete):

After clicking on the **Complete course** text, the student will be asked to confirm by
clicking on **Yes** or **No** :

Please note that students can click on this even if the required course activities are
not yet complete.

The activity and course completion reports are updated when the cron job is completed on the server. This captures the most up-to-date information in relation to Moodle activities to ensure the reports are up to date. If the reports need to be constantly up to date, the cron job might need to be set up to run regularly. Speak with your Moodle administrator to find out more about the cron job.

### Summary

The **Moodle Gradebook** may be as complex as student evaluation can be. They can also be used to show view of the elements that the student has achieved to date. Some characteristics we have discussed in this trainingmaterial have been:

- Election of resources and activities that are able to be reported on the Gradebook.
- Monitoring of activities completion.
- A deep look to the Gradebook key features.
- The default settings.
- _Gradebook Settings_ customization both, at course or teacher levels and those depending on the site administrator.
- 

Through the use of numerical grades, letter grades, and scales, a teacher can customize
their Gradebook to ensure that it can meet the specific course requirements. Where
required, a teacher can also make use of outcomes that can be used in conjunction with
a scale to demonstrate competency against specific criteria. Each type of grade has its
own benefits, but the options you would like to calculate the final grade should be
considered before you choose your grade type in order to ensure that it meets your
needs. Remember that numerical grades or grade letters can always be calculated in
a more straightforward manner than word grades (scales). Scales should only be used
when no grading or only simple grading is required. However, numerical grades and
letter grades can be used for more complex grading requirements.

We will now take a look at how to add these grading options to assignments within
Moodle before you learn how to grade work.

### Summary 3

In this chapter, we added a range of assignments that made use of number and scale
grades as well as added outcomes to an assignment. We also added two assignments
using the advanced grading methods that will enable us to grade assignments using
specific criteria. Finally, we added a graded item directly into the Gradebook.

In the next chapter, we will look at grading assessments. We will add number and scale
grades, add written feedback, grade outcomes, and make use of the marking guides
and rubrics we created. We will also review the options within the marking workflow,
use the offline grading worksheet, and grade work directly w
