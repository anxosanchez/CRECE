# Reporting with the

# Gradebook

So far, we have seen how we can use number, letter, and scale grades and how we can
add assignments to courses. We can grade assignments and set up the Gradebook to
calculate course totals.

We will now look at how we can view reports for all students as well as for individual
students and some of the other ways in which the grade reports can be customized and
exported. There are four main reports:

- The grader report
- The outcomes report
- The overview report
- The user report

### The grader report

We have already seen the grader report a few times throughout this book, as it is the
main screen we see when we go into the Gradebook.

To get to the grader report, we go to the **Grades** area:

1. Click on **Grades** in the **Administration** block.
2. If you are using the tabs layout, make sure that the **View** tab and **Grader**
   report are selected. If you are using the drop-down list to navigate the
   **Grades** area, ensure that the **Grader report** option under the **View**
   heading is selected.

*Reporting with the Gradebook*

You can see the tabs and the drop-down menu in the following screenshot:

This report shows you the grades of all the students for each graded activity.
This enables the teacher to see the progress of all students in one place.

The report shows you one student per row. For courses with many students, the
student rows might appear over two or more pages. In this case, a **Next** button will
appear to move to the next page of students. However, we can change how many
students are shown per page within the Gradebook preferences. If you have tabs
at the top of your screen, click on **Preferences**. If you're using the drop-down list,
choose **Grader report** under the **Preferences** heading. Within the **General** section,
there is an option to type in how many students per page you would like to view.
Click on **Save changes** to save this option.

Within each column, we can see the grade for each assignment. However, with a lot
of graded activities in the course, the grader report can be very wide. Categories can
be used to organize this content, but the grader report also lets us collapse information
to make it even easier to view.

```
Chapter 7
```

There are three main ways to collapse the information. The following screenshot shows
you two rows of grades (for two different students), and there are three categories set
up for this course ( **Unit 1** , **Unit 2** and **Unit 3** ), as shown in the top row. Each category
is displayed in a different way.

**Unit 1** has a **â€“** symbol next to it. This is the default way of viewing the category and
grade information, and it shows you the full expanded view of grades. It shows you
each graded activity within the category (in this case, **Task 1** and **Task 2** ) and the
**Category total** column.

**Unit 2** has a **+** symbol next to it. This shows you a collapsed view of the category,
and only shows you the **Category total** column and not the graded activities that
are in that category.

**Unit 3** has a square-based symbol next to it, and this shows you the graded activities
within the category but not the **Category total** column.

You can click on these symbols next to each category to toggle between each view.
The changes are made for the individual user and will be remembered each time
the user views the grader report. You can change the way the report is viewed at
any time.

```
The theme of the Moodle site might show alternative icons
to expand and collapse the category views.
```

A useful option for courses that have a lot of graded activities is to view the **Category
total** column only (so that the **+** symbol is displayed). This will show you all the
category totals in the course so that the grader report is not too detailed. The user can
then choose to view the full content of the category they are using at that point in time
(such as the current unit being delivered).

*Reporting with the Gradebook*

This is particularly useful for courses where different teachers teach different
units, as they can collapse the categories so that they only view the category
that they teach.

Another issue with a course that has a lot of content is related to having a lot of
students in the course. This can make the table very long and can be a particular
issue if there are a number of course groups that use the same online course.
Again, different teachers might grade different groups of students. However,
we can set up groups to enable teachers to only view the students they want.

#### Using groups to further improve the Gradebook's use

Groups are a course-wide feature, but this section will give you a quick overview
of how to set them up and use them within the Gradebook.

There are three elements that we need to address:

- Creating groups and adding students to groups
- Setting the assignments to enable group views
- Changing the course settings to view groups in the Gradebook

##### Creating groups

The following steps shows how to create a group in the Gradebook:

1. Go to the main screen of the course and view the **Administration** block.
   Choose **Users** and click on **Groups**.
2. At the bottom of this screen, click on **Create group**.
3. Type in the name of the group (such as Group A) and click on **Save changes**
   at the bottom of the screen. Repeat this process for each group required.
4. After the groups have been created, they will appear in the groups list on
   the left-hand side of the screen. Click on the first group in the list so that
   it is highlighted and then click on **Add/remove users** in the bottom-right
   corner of the screen.
5. In the right-hand column on the screen, all current members of the course will
   appear. Choose the students who should be part of this group by clicking on
   their name and then clicking on **Add** in the centre of the two columns. Repeat
   this process for each student.

```
Chapter 7
```

1. Once the process is complete, click on **Back to groups** at the bottom of the
   screen. Repeat this process for other groups.

##### Enabling assignments to use groups

Each assignment that we want to be able to grade in groups has to be set up to enable
the use of groups.

This is chosen in the common module settings of the assignment editing screen.
This can be done when we initially set up the assignments:

1. When viewing the assignment on the screen, click on **Edit settings** in the
   **Administration** block.
2. Find the **Common modules settings** section and click on the title to display the
   options. Find the **Group mode** option and change the option from **No groups**
   to **Visible groups** or **Separate groups** and **Save and display** the assignment.

*Reporting with the Gradebook*

1. View the assignment and feedback grading area from within the assignment
   by clicking on the **View/grade all submissions** text.
2. In the top-left section of the assignment area, you will now see a **Visible**
   **groups** or **Separate groups** drop-down list.

You can use this drop-down list to choose the group that you would like to view.
This will filter the students and show only the students in the chosen group. You
can still view all participants to see all the students on the grading screen.

##### Viewing the groups in the Gradebook

If we want to view these groups in the grader report, we need to change the course
settings:

1. From the main course screen, go to the **Administration** block and click on
   **Edit settings** under the **Course administration** heading.
2. Scroll down the page and click on the **Groups** option. Change **Group**
   **mode** to **Visible groups** or **Separate groups**.
3. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on **Save changes**.
4. From the **Administration** block, click on **Grades** to go back to the
   **Grader report**.
5. You will notice that the **Visible groups** or **Separate groups** drop-down
   lists are now available at the top of the grader report. Teachers can filter
   to view groups of students or view all students along with the relevant
   course grades.

Apart from showing assignment grades for each student, the grader report will also
show the outcome grade. However, as the grader report has a lot of information, it can
be difficult for the teacher to see whether each outcome is being achieved throughout
the whole course. The outcomes report provides a summary of the outcomes used in
the course and shows the average outcome grades for the course based on the outcome
grades given to date.

```
Chapter 7
```

### Outcomes report

The outcomes report is used in courses where outcomes have been added to
the course. Details of how to enable and add outcomes are provided in *Chapter 2* ,
*Customizing Grades*. If you have tabs at the top of your screen, click on **View** and
then click on the **Outcomes report** under the tabs. If you're using the drop-down
list, choose **Outcomes report** under the **View** heading.

The outcomes report can help the teacher see which outcomes are being achieved
and at what level; it also helps them see which ones might require additional support
or development.

This previous report lists the three outcomes that have been used within this course.
These are shown in the first column with the **Short name** title.

The second column shows you the average grade for each outcome. This average is
based on the grades awarded for the outcome divided by the number of times this
outcome has been graded. The average is shown in the same scale, as the outcome is
graded but the number in brackets is the equivalent number value. Remember that
the numbers used by scales are based on the number of items in the scale. In this
example, there are three options in the scale ( **Not yet complete** , **Partially complete** ,
and **Complete** ), which means that the maximum number will be three. The average
for **Evidence provided** is **2.17** and therefore, it will display the **Partially complete**
scale value as this is item number two in the scale list.

The **Site-wide** column will state **Yes** or **No** , depending on whether the outcome is
used in this course only (in which case, it will say **No** ) or whether the outcomes are
used throughout the Moodle site (in which case, it will say **Yes** ).

*Reporting with the Gradebook*

The final three columns provide additional details for how the outcomes are used.
The **Activities** column shows you each activity that has this outcome assigned.
The **Average** column will show you the average grade for the task, and the final
**Number of grades** column shows you how many grades this average is based on.

### Overview report

The next report that is available is the overview report. (If you have tabs at the top of
your screen, click on **View** and then click on the **Overview report** under the tabs. If
you're using the drop-down list, choose **Overview report** under the **View** heading.)
This can be accessed from any course, but it enables a teacher to view the current
course totals of each student for all the courses in which they are currently enrolled
on Moodle.

After clicking on **Overview report** , a list of courses will appear, but the first step
is to choose a user or student for whom we want to see the current course results.
This drop-down list appears on the right-hand side next to **Select a user**.

Once a user has been chosen, the course list will change and display all the courses
that the chosen student is enrolled in, and the grade column will show the current
grade awarded for each course.

The current grade shows the same grade that appears in the **Course total** column of
the grader report for each individual course. This grade is likely to change throughout
the duration of the course.

The overview report enables teachers to view students' progress across a number of
Moodle courses without having to visit each course individually. However, the teacher
can choose to review the details of an individual student's progress by clicking on the
**Course name** option in the overview list. This will show you the user report of the
learner for the chosen course.

```
Chapter 7
```

### User report

You can access the user report in the same way as the grader and overview reports.
If you're using the drop-down list, find the **View** heading and click on **User report**.
If you're using the tabs menu, click on **View** , and then click on **User report** , which
is shown under the tabs.

Like the overview report, the user report requires the teacher to choose a user from
the drop-down list on the right-hand side (unless the user report is accessed via the
overview report or by clicking on the grades icon next to the student's name in the
grader report).

The user report will show you each graded activity in the course along with the current
grade awarded for each activity and the feedback given. This has the same information
as the grader report, but this information is for an individual student. It also presents
the information in a portrait rather than landscape format (the following screenshot
only has a few activities within the Gradebook, but for courses with a lot of graded
activities, the page will be longer).

*Reporting with the Gradebook*

The user report shows you each graded activity from the course in the **Grade item**
column with the current **Grade** value awarded next to it. Finally, the **Feedback**
column shows you any written feedback given for the activity. If we click on the
name of the activity, we can access the full assessment information.

The final row of the column shows you the **Course total** grade so far. This is the
same information as what is shown in the **Course total** column in the grader report
and in the overview report. In the previous screenshot, this is **48.11**.

### Reports that students see

A student can access the Gradebook in the same way as a teacher. They will click on
**Grades** in the **Administration** block.

When a student views their grades, it is their own user report that they will see.
Students can also view the overview report. Both reports look the same for the
students as they do for the teacher. However, they can only see their own reports,
whereas a teacher can view the reports for all students in the course.

```
By default, the Gradebook is available for students to view. If you
would like to turn off access to the grades for students, you can do
this in the course settings. Go to the Administration block and click
on Edit settings under the Course Administration heading. Click
on the Appearance title and find the Show gradebook to students
option and change it from Yes to No.
```

### Customizing the reports view

We have seen how the grader, outcomes, overview, and user reports can be used
and the information that can be shown on each. The information shown in the
screenshots used is based on the default settings of each report. However, each
of the reports can also be customized to change the information shown.

Within the **Grades** area of the course, there is a **Settings** section that can be used
to change how each report is viewed in the course.

This is accessed through the **Settings** tab (if using the tabs layout) or by clicking
on the drop-down list. Find the **Settings** heading and click on **Course** (if using the
drop-down list option).

```
Chapter 7
```

A range of options are available for each report type, as shown in the following
screenshot:

*Reporting with the Gradebook*

Change the settings to meet your needs and click on **Save changes** at the bottom of the
screen. These settings will be applied to the course rather than the individual user.

```
Try changing the settings to see how they can customize
your Gradebook and meet your needs.
```

### Exporting the Gradebook data

Apart from viewing the data within Moodle, it is possible to export the Gradebook
data and download it to view and use offline. There are four options that are
available to download it:

- An OpenDocument spreadsheet
- A plain text file
- An Excel spreadsheet
- An XML file

You access these options from the **Grades** area in Moodle in the same way as you
access the reports. How you access the export options will depend on whether you are
using the drop-down menu or tab navigation within the **Grades** area. Both options
are shown in the following screenshot. If you're using the drop-down menu, find the
**Export** heading and click on **OpenDocument spreadsheet** (you can also choose other
export options from here). If you're using the tabs layout, click on the **Export** tab.
Within the export tab, a second row of options appears, which provides you with the
export options.

```
Chapter 7
```

Once you are on the export screen, a range of options are available for you to choose
the information to be exported and downloaded.

*Reporting with the Gradebook*

These options are explained as follows:

- **Include feedback in export** : This includes the written feedback alongside
  the exported data. To include this, we need to click on the box to add a tick.
- **Exclude suspended users** : This is chosen as the default so that only active
  students are in the exported report. However, if you have any users in the
  course who have been assigned as suspended but require the data, we will
  need to remove this tick.
- **Preview rows** : This allows us to choose the number of rows of student data
  that will be shown once the options are submitted. This allows the teacher
  to check the data to ensure that it displays the information required before
  finally exporting the information.
- **Grade export display type** : With this, the teacher can choose whether the
  real, percentage, or letter grade is the grade shown in the exported data
  and how many decimal points are shown with the **Grade export decimal**
  **points** option.
- **Grade items to be included** : With this, the second part of the options will
  display all the graded activities, category totals, and the course totals that
  are included in the online course. The teacher can choose which elements
  they would like in the exported data. For example, a teacher might only
  want to export the data for their own unit. A tick in the box will indicate
  that the data is to be exported. All items will be ticked by default. Clicking
  on the tick will remove the tick and therefore, will not include the data in
  the export.
- Click on **Submit** to start the export process.

After clicking on **Submit** , a preview screen will appear with a **Download** button on it.

The **Download** button will download the chosen Gradebook data in the
selected format.

```
Chapter 7
```

### Summary

In this chapter, we saw the range of ways in which the Gradebook can be used and
customized to display the data required for both teachers and students.

Teachers can see all student grades and individual user data as well as set up groups to
aid the marking and review process. Students and teachers can also see an overview of
all the courses that a user is enrolled on to see the current final grade for each course.

These reports provide the main options to view grades. However, there are a few
further customizations that can aid the progress tracking. The final chapter will
outline some of these options to further enable the tracking of students' progress.
