<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>If you area moodle user, and teacher, you probably need to make the avaliation of the outcomes. The Gradebook can be a valuable tool that will help you to track the students’ progress through assessment and required activities. You wi’ll need</p>
<ul>
<li>An access to the gradebook.</li>
<li>Leran how the Gradebook is presented.</li>
<li>Know about the information provided by the gradebook.</li>
<li>Key features and activities of the gradebook.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not very used to gradebook terms, please take a llok before to the <a href="##Gradebook%20Glossary%20of%20Terms">glossary section</a></p>
<h2 id="accessing-the-gradebook">Accessing the Gradebook</h2>
<p>All courses in Moodle have a grading area, known as the <strong>Gradebook</strong>. A lot of activities provided by Moodle can be graded. All of these results go to the Gradebook.</p>
<p>Depending on the configuration ant the appearance decided by your moodle administrator, the <strong>Gradebook</strong> can appear or not as a direct acces on the dashboard or the left menu of your moodle course. An example can be seen in the [figure 1]. In thsi case tht gradebook has a direc acces from the left menu.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/f1.png" alt="Figure 1. Accesing the GradeBook."  /></p>

<p>Selecting the grades from the menu, we access to the main gradebook as we can see in figure 2.</p>

<figure>
<img src="../../images/f2.PNG" alt="" />

<small>Figure 2. Starting the gradebook from the menu</small>.

<figure>
<p>You can see two rows in the menu:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Top row: <strong>View</strong>, <strong>Setup</strong>, <strong>Scales</strong>, <strong>Letters</strong>, <strong>Import</strong> and <strong>Export</strong> options.</p></li>
<li><p>Bottom row: <strong>Grade report</strong>, <strong>Grade history</strong>, <strong>Outcomes report</strong>, <strong>Overview report</strong>, <strong>Single view</strong> and <strong>User report</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Graded activities automatically appear in the grades area when they are added into the main course.</p></li>
<li><p>Left-hand side contains the students’ names and some data.</p></li>
<li><p>On the far right-hand side of the table is the <strong>Course total</strong> , which is calculated based on the grades activities. By default, you can see averages but the it is configurable.</p></li>
<li><p>At the bottom you can see a row with <strong>Overall average</strong> as a column, containing the average of all the grades within each assessment type.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Gradebook captures all the assessment information on one screen. But the overall view can be be overwhelming. Fortunately, moodle is highly configurable to show what uyou need.</p>
<p>Dependeing of your role (teacher, non-editing teacher, or manager, etc.) you can see or not some features. Students will only be able to see their own grades and feedback.</p>
<p>Adventages of storing the grades this way are:</p>
<ul>
<li>information can be easily shared between teachers.</li>
<li>if a course manager want to know how students were progressing it fast.</li>
<li>students can see all their progress in one place and can start to manage their own learning.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="activities-that-work-with-the-gradebook">Activities that work with the Gradebook</h2>
<p>There are a number of Moodle activities that can be graded and, therefore, work with the Gradebook. The activities that will automatically appear in the Gradebook are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assignments</li>
<li>Quizzes</li>
<li>Lessons</li>
<li>The SCORM package</li>
<li>Workshops</li>
</ul>
<p>A number of other Moodle activities can also have grades and ratings assigned to them so that they also appear in the Gradebook. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forums</li>
<li>Glossaries</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also possible to manually set up a <em>graded item</em> within the Gradebook, which is not linked with an activity but allows a grade to be recorded, but this, in some cases, require administration privileges. For further information, read the <a href="https://docs.moodle.org/310/en/Main_page">moodle docs</a>.</p>
<h2 id="gradebook-key-features">Gradebook Key features</h2>
<p>Gradebook contains the score for each graded activity that can be presented in various ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Numerical grade</strong> : ( by default scored to 100 ).</li>
<li><strong>Scale</strong> : Customized grading that can be:
<ul>
<li>letters.</li>
<li>words.</li>
<li>statements.</li>
<li>numbers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Letter grade</strong> : linked to percentages (e. g. 100% = A+).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="organizing-grades">Organizing grades</h3>
<p>With lots of activities that use grades within a course, the Gradebook will have a lot of data on one page. Categories can be created for group activities, and the Gradebook view can be customized according to the user for them to see all or some categories on the screen.</p>
<h1 id="customizing-grades">Customizing Grades</h1>
<p>When you create an activity, you will choose how the activity will be scored and added into the course’s grades area. Default grading are number grades (0–100) and a preset scale called <strong>Separate and connected ways of knowing</strong>[^1].</p>
<p>Some characteristics of gradebook concerning customizing are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Different courses can use different grading conventions</li>
<li>It is possible to customize all the grades</li>
<li>Letter grades can be customized too</li>
<li>Scales can be created by teachers within a course.</li>
<li>Site-wide scales, (Standard scales) , can be created only by an administrator.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="numeric-grades">Numeric grades</h2>
<p>100 is the default grade for all assessments in Moodle. If you want to grade assignments with scores higher than 100, only the administrators can change the maximum grade possible[^2].</p>
<h2 id="letter-grades">Letter grades</h2>
<p>Some assessments or activities can be graded with a letter (<strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, etc.). <strong>Letter grades</strong> are number grades shown as letters in the Gradebook.</p>
<p>To link number to th letters, percentages are used. Figure 3 show a table of conversion to letter grades (moodle default conversio table.</p>

<h3 id="customizing-letter-grades">Customizing letter grades</h3>
<p>The ability to edit the grade letters to meet specific course needs enables us to present information in the Gradebook to staff and students, which has more meaning than numbers alone can provide. For example, if our student needs to achieve 60 percent to pass the assignment, we can customize the letter grades to indicate that anything graded at 60 percent or more shows the word <strong>Pass</strong> as the grade, and anything below 60 percent shows the word <strong>Fail</strong>. This will make more sense to the student than the number grade. Let’s set up an example and see an alternative use of the letter grades.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-letter-grade-that-uses-words">Creating a letter grade that uses words</h3>
<p>The letter grades can be customized to link to any percentage. The letters can also be changed into words (e. g. <strong>Aprobado</strong>, <strong>Notable</strong>, <strong>Sobresaliente</strong>, etc.).</p>
<p>In this example, we are going to set up letter grades that enable teachers to grade the assignment below of 50, to pass the subject, and so the assignment will be graded as <strong>SUSPENSO</strong>, teacher has to score the assignments with numbers, but the students will see the word as their grade. But for the final course total, Moodle uses the numbers to calculate the final grade.</p>
<p>We can to customize the letter grades and their the equivalent percentages for the different grade levels.</p>
<p>The following table shows you the final grade linked to the different grade levels and the calculated percentage in Spanish Acedemic Records:</p>

<h2 id="scales-for-grade-assignments">Scales for grade assignments</h2>
<p>Scales are a list of words or characters that can be used to grade assignments. Each scale needs at least two choices, but you can have as many words in the scale as you want. You can also use lots of different scales simultaneously:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aprobado Suspenso</li>
<li>Deficiente, Avceptable, Bueno, Escelente</li>
<li>Revisable or Progresa Adecuadamente</li>
</ul>
<p>Scale is created prior to the graded activity. When an activity is added to the course you must choose the required scale. Once created a assigned, teacher see the scale options in a drop-down list to select the grade to be awarded.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a scale has been used, it can no longer be edited.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scales be used to calculate final grades, but the scores are based on the number of items in the scale rather than a specific score for each element of the scale. However, additional weightings can be used to increase the point value. The use of weightings will be explained later Calculating scores using scales can be confusing and therefore, scales are not always the best option when complex scoring is required. However, for courses that use simple calculations or where there is a point at which a learner will pass, scales can be a useful way to present course grades that will make sense to students.</p>

<h2 id="using-outcomes">Using Outcomes</h2>
<p>Outcomes are extra elements that can be added to a graded activity in order to be able to grade specific elements that have been completed. Each outcome can be graded with <strong>Scale</strong> , but the teacher must also put in an overall grade for the graded activity. Outcomes can be especially useful for courses that require a competence oriented evaluation of students, like is recommended in Europe after the Higher Education Integration by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna_Process">Bolonia Process</a> [^4].</p>
<p>We will set up some outcomes to enable us to assess whether specific criteria is completed and evidence has been provided. We will make use of the Completion scale that we have just set up [^5].</p>
<p>To create outcomes that we can use to assess elements of the assignment follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Criteria 1 met</li>
<li>Criteria 2 met</li>
<li>Evidence provided</li>
</ul>
<p>is show as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color:blue">Full name and short name<br>Scale Description<br>Criteria 2 met Completion All elements of criteria 2 have been met<br>Criteria 1 met Completion All elements of criteria 1 have been met</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Outcomes can only be deleted before they are added to an assignment. Once it is used in an assignment, the delete option will not be available, but you will still be able to edit. However, if the outcome is removed from all assignments, we will be able to delete the outcome from the course. Later, we’ll discuss again the outcomes.</p>
<h1 id="adding-graded-activities">Adding Graded Activities</h1>
<p>Adding an activity means toggle <strong>Turn editing on</strong> within the course. All graded activities are added through the <strong>Add an activity or resource text</strong> available within each section of the course (figure 6).</p>

<h3 id="alternative-grading-methods">Alternative grading methods</h3>
<p>Within the <strong>Grade</strong> section, there are three types of grading methods, and so far, we have only used the default <strong>Simple direct grading</strong> option. However, there are two other types of grading methods: <strong>Marking guide</strong> and <strong>Rubric</strong>.</p>
<p>The simple direct grading option enables us to choose the grade options (such as number or a scale), and the teacher adds the grade that is awarded to the student. The alternative grading methods use a very different grading process. The teacher does not select the final overall grade but grades individual criteria instead, and the score for each of these is added together to create the final grade. When creating an assignment that uses <strong>Marking guide</strong> or <strong>Rubric</strong> , we need to identify the criteria that will be used to assess the assignment.</p>
<h4 id="the-marking-guide-method">The marking guide method</h4>
<p>The marking guide’s grading method allows us to add criteria and identify a top grade for each piece of criteria. When grading the assignment, the teacher will choose the grade to be awarded and can also add specific feedback. We will be setting up three criteria, two with a top mark of 5 and one with a top mark of 10.</p>
<p>If the student is graded with the top marks for each of the three criteria, they will receive the maximum grade of twenty. Let’s add this together:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Click on the <strong>Turn editing on</strong> button.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Add an activity or resource</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Assignment</strong> and then click on <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Assignment name</strong> box, type in the name of the assignment (such as Assignment 4).</li>
<li>In the <strong>Description box</strong> , provide the assignment details.</li>
<li>Within the <strong>Grades</strong> section, navigate to <strong>Grade</strong> | <strong>Type</strong> and set it to <strong>Point</strong> and ensure that <strong>Maximum points</strong> is set to 20. Change <strong>Grading method</strong> to <strong>Marking guide</strong> using the drop-down list.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>Please note that the criteria does not need to add up to the
maximum grade given for the assignment, as Moodle will
convert the final grade received for the assignment to a decimal
(by adding together the grade awarded for each criterion and
dividing this by 100). This will be multiplied by the maximum
grade set for the assignment. This is a normalization process that
is explained in much more detail in Chapter 5 , Using Calculations.</code></pre>
<ol type="1">
<li>Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on <strong>Save and display</strong>. The next step is to set up the marking guide, where the screen will look like the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>

<ol type="1">
<li>After opening the grading form, we need to add in a name for the marking guide and description. Add some information to these boxes (for the following example, we can name the marking guide <strong>Presentation</strong> and the description <strong>Present your ideas for a research project</strong> ).</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>Chapter 3</code></pre>
<ol type="1">
<li>The next section is the actual <strong>Marking guide</strong> setup area, which has a place to add the first criterion. There are three elements for each criterion: ° <strong>Description for Students</strong> : This is the information that a student will see in order to find out the assignment criteria. This will only be shown if the option for students to view the criteria is turned on. ° <strong>Description for Markers</strong> : This information will be seen by teachers when they are grading the work and will help the teacher identify the grade to be awarded to the student. ° <strong>Maximum mark</strong> : A teacher can choose the maximum grade possible for this criteria. When grading, the teacher can choose any grade from zero to this maximum number.</li>
<li>Under the <strong>Marking guide</strong> title, click on the <strong>Click to edit</strong> criterion name and add the text Planning.</li>
<li>Under the <strong>Description for Students</strong> title, click on <strong>Click to edit</strong>. Add the this to the box: The presentation has been planned to include an initial overview plus as outline of each type of research.</li>
<li>Within the <strong>Description for Markers</strong> section, click on the <strong>Click to edit</strong> text and add: To gain top marks the overview must be very clear including the research question.

<li><p>The next section to set up a marking guide is the <strong>Frequently used</strong> <strong>comments</strong> area where we can add statements that can be used when grading the assignment. Click on <strong>Add frequently used comment</strong> and type in Confidently presented and Evidence of planning and preparation.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, we have two marking guide options that can be turned on and off using the tick boxes. Keep both of these turned on. Your completed marking guide should look like this:</p></li>

<pre><code>If we have not completed our marking guide, we can click on
Save as draft and then come back to it via the Advanced grading
link within the assignment administration block.</code></pre>
<ol type="1">
<li>The next screen will indicate that the marking guide is now ready for use. You can still click on <strong>Edit the Current form definition</strong> or <strong>Delete the</strong> <strong>currently defined form</strong> to start a new form or to revert to the simple direct grading method. You can also click on <strong>Publish this form as a new template</strong> so that it can be used for other assignments and in other courses.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will look at how to grade work using the marking guide in <em>Chapter 4</em> , <em>Assigning Grades</em>.</p>
<h4 id="the-rubrics-method">The rubrics method</h4>
<p>The second method of alternative grading is called Rubrics. <strong>Rubrics</strong> allow a set of criteria to be set up for the assessment along with descriptors that outline the different levels at which the criteria are met. Each descriptor has a value that enables Moodle to calculate a final grade for the assessment based on the criteria met. Rubrics are a more detailed version of the marking guide, and they make the grading process simple for the teacher and students.</p>
<pre><code>Chapter 3</code></pre>
<p>When using the Rubric grading method, we will need to create a grading form in a similar way in order to create the marking guide. We will set up a rubric assignment together:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Click on <strong>Turn editing on</strong> button.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Add an activity or resource</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Assignment</strong> and then click on <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Assignment name</strong> box, type in the name of the assignment (such as Assignment 5).</li>
<li>In the <strong>Description</strong> box, provide the assignment details as Core criteria of an assignment.</li>
<li>Within the <strong>Grades</strong> section navigate to <strong>Grade</strong> | <strong>Type</strong> and set it to <strong>Point</strong> and ensure that <strong>Maximum points</strong> is set to 30. Change <strong>Grading method</strong> to <strong>Rubric</strong>.</li>
<li>Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on <strong>Save and display</strong>. You will see an advanced grading screen like the one shown in the following screenshot:</li>
<li>From this screen, we will choose the <strong>Define new grading form from scratch</strong> option. However, note that you can also select <strong>Create new grading form</strong> <strong>from a template</strong>. This enables you to use grading forms that you have already created in this or other courses or use standard (site-wide) forms created on the Moodle site.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Adding Graded Activities</em></p>
<pre><code>As with the marking guide, if no rubric form is created at this stage,
the simple direct grading method will be used; this means that the
teacher will manually add in the final grade rather than grade the
assignment using the criteria.</code></pre>
<ol type="1">
<li>As this is the first form we have created, click on <strong>Define new grading form</strong> <strong>from scratch</strong>. The following screenshot will appear:</li>
<li>In the <strong>Name</strong> box, type in the name for this set of rubric criteria. For this example, we will call it Core assignment criteria. You can also add a description to the <strong>Description</strong> box (this is useful when sharing rubrics or searching for your own rubrics in order to use them as templates).</li>
</ol>
<p>We will be completing the rubric criterion and level boxes, but first let’s find out how rubrics are used and what these options are.</p>
<pre><code>Chapter 3</code></pre>
<p>Within a rubric, there is at least one criterion, and each criterion has specific levels of grading. The criterion is an element of the assignment that needs to be met. The levels are the extent to which this criterion has been met. Statements are added and are used to assess the work, and when grading we can choose the relevant statement based on the extent to which this criterion has been met. For assignments that have multiple criteria, the points awarded for each criterion are added together to create the final grade.</p>
<p>The default setting within a rubric is for one criterion, with three points levels ranging from zero to two points. Additional criterion as well as additional grading levels for each criterion can be added (the number of grading levels can also be removed so that there can be fewer than three grading levels). The points awarded for each level can also be amended.</p>
<p>We will be setting up three criteria, each with a top grade of 10. If the student is graded the top marks for each of the three criteria, they will receive the top grade of 30 (we set 30 as the maximum grade when we added the assignment).</p>
<pre><code>As with the marking guide, the criteria does not need to always add
up to the maximum grade given for the assignment, as a normalization
process will convert the grade. This will be explained in Chapter 5 ,
Using Calculations.</code></pre>
<p>You can see the criteria we will be using in the following table; we will be using the same point system for each level in this example:</p>
<pre><code>Criterion 0 points 3 points 6 points 10 points

<p><em>Adding Graded Activities</em></p>
<p>Let’s add these criteria and levels to the course. We will add the first one together:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Click on the gray <strong>Click to edit criterion</strong> text to add the criteria detail.</li>
<li>Type in the first criterion (The assignment should be 1000 words). You can make the text box larger by holding your cursor in the bottom-right section of the box and dragging the box to make it bigger.</li>
<li>Click on the gray <strong>Click to edit level</strong> text in the box on the right-hand side of the criterion we have just added. This is where we need to type the statement for the zero points level shown in the preceding table (The word count is below 800 words or over 1200 words). Make sure the <strong>points</strong> box reads 0.</li>
<li>Click on the next gray <strong>Click to edit level</strong> text in the box (currently, the 1 points level). Type in the three points level statement from the table. Change the points number to 3.</li>
<li>Click on the last available level box and add in the six points statement and change the number of points to 6.</li>
<li>We have now run out of the default number of levels but we still need to add the ten points level. Click on the <strong>Add level</strong> button on the right-hand side of the current level that we are working on.</li>
<li>Add in the level statement for ten points and change the points to 10.</li>
<li>Click anywhere on the screen to finalize this text.</li>
<li>We now need to add another line for the next criterion. Under the current criterion, there is a <strong>Add criterion</strong> button. Click on this and an additional row to add another criterion and the level statements and points will appear. Use the preceding table to complete this rubric. Once completed, your rubric table should look like this:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>Chapter 3</code></pre>
<ol type="1">
<li>Underneath the criteria section of the rubric creation page, there are a number of options that show you how the rubric can be used. The text explains the options, and these are turned on by adding a tick and turned off by removing the tick. Keep them all turned on, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Adding Graded Activities</em></p>

<li>Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on <strong>Save rubric and make it ready</strong>.</li>
<li>The rubric is now ready for use when grading the assignment. We will look at how to grade this in the next chapter.</li>
<li>If you want to edit your rubric, you will need to use the <strong>Administration</strong> block when you are viewing the assignment on the screen. Click on <strong>Advanced</strong> <strong>grading</strong> and then choose <strong>Define rubric</strong> , which will take you to the Rubric editing screen.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="adding-additional-grading-directly-into-the-gradebook">Adding additional grading directly into the Gradebook</h3>
<p>We have looked at how we can add graded activities to a Moodle course so that they can be awarded a mark and used with the Gradebook. This is the main way in which we grade an assessment, as the students need to complete something in order to be graded (such as an assignment, quiz, discussion, or any other Moodle activity). We can also use the assignment tool to provide feedback on a student’s assignment even if the students do not submit any work online, such as class presentations or practical work.</p>
<p>However, what if we would like a grade that is not linked to an activity to be added to the Gradebook? Perhaps students receive an additional grade based on their attendance in lessons. You might want the grade to be in the Gradebook for the final course grade but you do not want it to appear as an activity within the Moodle course. This is where a <strong>Graded item</strong> , added directly into the Moodle Gradebook, can be useful. The following steps indicate the steps to be followed:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>From the main course screen, find the <strong>Administration</strong> block and click on <strong>Grades</strong> to get to the Gradebook.</li>
<li>Go into the <strong>Categories and items</strong> screen (click on the <strong>Categories and items</strong> tab on the top of the page if the tabs are available. Otherwise, click on the drop-down list and click on <strong>Simple view</strong> under the <strong>categories and items</strong> heading).</li>
<li>Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on the <strong>Add</strong> grade item. The following screenshot will appear:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>Chapter 3</code></pre>
<ol type="1">
<li>Give the graded item a name (add in the Attendance grade title).</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>There are four Grade types available for graded items:
° Value : This enables a number grade to be awarded. If this is used,
the maximum and minimum grades possible can be set. For this
example, we will keep the default options of Minimum grade
0.00 and Maximum grade 100.00).
° Scale : This allows you to choose a scale that is available within
the course in order to grade this item. If this is chosen, the scale&#39;s
drop-down list becomes available to enable us to choose the scale
we would like to use.
° Text : This does not allow any grade to be used, but written feedback
can be added. This will not be used in Gradebook calculations.
° None : This means that no grade is assigned to this item.</code></pre>

<h2 id="grading-with-a-marking-guides">Grading with a marking guides</h2>
<p>The difference is that previous grading pages is the way in which the assignment is graded.</p>
<ul>
<li>When grading with a scale, th add the grade appears a drop-down</li>
<li>For a numerical grade, we there is a textbox to type the grade.</li>
<li>For a marking guide assignment, there is no single grade entry point.</li>
<li>Select the criteria titled <em>Planning</em>:
<ul>
<li>We can see the full details of the criteria that aids us by providing us with the correct grade.</li>
<li>We have a textbox where we can add feedback in relation to this criteria.</li>
<li>When add <em>Frequently used comments</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The final column provides a grade entry box. We can see the maximum number of points that are available for this criteria. We have to add a number grade up to the given maximum grade.</li>
<li>Click <em>Save changes</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following the grading, each score assigned to each piece of criteria is added together in order to provide the final grade for the student, and this can be seen in the <em>Grade</em>, in the assignment grading table. Sudents will see the final grade and each individual criteria grade and feedback when reviewing the feedback for their assignment.</p>
<h2 id="grading-with-rubrics">Grading with rubrics</h2>
<p>The rubric table enables us to easily grade work even though there is a lot of information on the screen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teacher reviews the work and clicks on the box containing the statement and points to award.</li>
<li>Written feedback in the textbox can be added.</li>
<li>The shaded boxes show the grade awarded for each criterion and comments.</li>
<li>Final grade is calculated adding together each of the points awarded within the rubric.</li>
<li>As with the <em>marking guide</em>, the student will see the full rubric table and comments when they receive their assignment feedback.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="grading-a-graded-item-in-the-gradebook">Grading a graded item in the Gradebook</h2>
<p>We also can add a graded activity directly into the Gradebook:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>From the main course go to <em>Grades</em> (<em>Administration</em> then <em>Grades</em> ).</li>
<li>Click on <em>Turn editing on</em> button.</li>
<li>Ypu are able to add a grade directly into the graded item.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can see the <em>Attendance grade</em> option. This item was set up as a value grade. To add the grade, type a number into the empty textbox. There is an <em>Update</em> button that saves any grades added. This grading method applies to any other type of graded activity within the Gradebook.</p>
<h2 id="quick-grading">Quick grading</h2>
<p>Turning editing on allow us to grade any graded activity.</p>
<p>In the previous screenshot, we can see different types of grades. <strong>Task 1</strong> is an example of an assignment that is graded with a scale and, therefore, quick grading provides a drop-down list that enables us to choose the grade we would like to award. <strong>Task 2</strong> and <strong>Task 3</strong> , however, have been set as numerical grades, so we need to type the number into the grade box. Also, as part of <strong>Task 3</strong> , there are two columns that show you outcomes that are graded using a drop-down list that chooses a scale item.</p>
<p>After we have amended grades on this screen, we need to click on the <strong>Update</strong> button 0to save the grades.</p>
<p>There are a few things to consider when using quick grading:</p>
<ul>
<li>We cannot see the maximum grade when adding number grades.</li>
<li>The marking guide and rubric-graded assignments cannot be marked via the quick grading option.</li>
</ul>
<p>When using the quick grading option,you can choose to add quick feedback to enable this follow these steps:</p>
<table>

<p>The quick feedback option is limited to adding text, so if a lot of text is required, it is recommended that the individual grading screen be used.</p>
<h1 id="calculations">Calculations</h1>
<p>There are various options and settings available to calculate and display a final grade in the Gradebook.</p>
<h2 id="calculations-on-the-grade">Calculations on the grade</h2>
<p>All graded activities that are added to the online course will automatically be added to the Gradebook. Students can have a range of assessments for which they will be given a range of scores. The Moodle Gradebook:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stores the grades.</li>
<li>Calculate a final grade based on a set of rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>This implies a previous normalization process. Normalization means that when the grade given to an individual assessment, is converted into a decimal number for the calculation.</p>
<h2 id="reasons-to-use-normalization">Reasons to use normalization</h2>
<p>Normalization is required in order to ensure that all the grades have the same base value so that they can be calculated fairly in relation to the maximum grade. To calculate a fair total, we need both of the grades to be recalculated to a decimal so that they have the same base value prior to adding them together for the final course grade.</p>
<p>Calculation of normalization is the grade awarded, divided by the total grade possible so that all the graded activities have a base value of 10.</p>
<p>The following table shows this for the two activities in this example:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">

<p>The normalization shows that the two awarded scores of 10 should not “weight” the same in the final course grade as they have significantly different decimal scores. This is this score that is used in the aggregation process.</p>
<h2 id="aggregation-types">Aggregation types</h2>
<p>A wide range of aggregation types is available in Moodle. For the preceeding examples, the normalized grades of 1.0, 0.25, and 0.5 as shown in the previous example, will be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>mean of grades</em> is the average score calculated as: (1.0 + 0.25 +0.5)/3=0.583.</li>
<li>The <em>weighted mean of grades</em> means that each item has a weight so the final grade is normalized. For example if first assessment has “x1” weight, the second “x2” and the thirt “x3”, the final grade is calculated as: (1.0 + 0.25·2 + 0.5·3)/3 = 0.5.</li>
<li>The <em>Simple weighted mean of grades</em> is the default aggregation method (no settings changed). For example, one activity scores 100, other 50. The Gradebook first normalizes the grade and then multiplies that grade by the total grade possible.</li>
<li>The <em>mean of grades (with extra credit)</em> is kept to be compatible with older Moodle versions.</li>
<li>The <em>median of grades</em> uses mean insterad of average.</li>
<li>The <em>lowest grade</em> reviews all the grades after normalization and presents the lowest score.</li>
<li>The <em>highest grade</em> reviews all the grades after normalization and presents the highest score.</li>
<li>The <em>mode of grades</em> reviews and takes the most frequently is presented as the final grade, for example, 0.2, 1.0, and 1.0. The final grade is 1.0.</li>
<li><em>Sum of grades</em> is the only aggregation method that does not use normalization.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="maximum-grades">Maximum grades</h4>
<p>It is possible to set a maximum score, then, Moodle calculate the final score based on it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>E.g. For example, 5 assessments each with a maximum grade of 250 sum 1250. However, the final grade might be 10. Therefore the aggregation convert the final score to 10 (not 1250).</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p>We have are three graded activities, each with a different maximum.</p>
<p>The aggregation is set then as a calculation, the average of the grades. The maximum grade possible for the whole course is 10.</p>

<p>The preceding table can be explained as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(a)</strong> : To calculate the normalized grade, the grade awarded is divided by the maximum grade for each assignment.</li>
<li><strong>(b)</strong> : The mean aggregation grade is calculated by adding together the normalized grade for each of the grade items. This is then divided by five (the total number of grades awarded).</li>
<li><strong>(c)</strong> : The final grade is 84 as the mean aggregation grade is multiplied by 100, which is the course maximum. If the course maximum was 30, the final grade would be <em>25.2 (0.84*30=25.2)</em>.</li>

<p>As done previously, the grade awarded is normalized. However, in this aggregation method, this normalized grade is multiplied by the maximum grade possible for the assessed activity. (In theory, the normalization process is not required in this aggregation type, as the normalization and weighting calculations cancel each other back to the original grade awarded. However, in practice, Moodle always normalizes this aggregation type.) However, the calculation of the mean aggregation is different in this method.</p>
<p>Instead of dividing the normalized total by the number of grades in the course (in our example, this meant dividing the total by three), the simple weighted mean aggregation divides the normalized total by the total maximum grade possible (which is each of the maximum grades for each activity added together). In this case, it divides the normalized and weighted total by 250.</p>
<p>There is one final method of calculating a mean grade and this requires some additional options to be set by the teacher. Let’s have a go at using the ‘weighted mean of grades’ aggregation method.</p>
<h4 id="the-weighted-mean-of-grades">The weighted mean of grades</h4>
<p>In this method, each graded item in the course is manually given a weighting. In the mean of grades method, there is no weighting involved as it is a simple average calculation. In the simple weighted mean of grades, the weighting is based on the maximum grade possible for each graded item. In a weighted mean, the teacher sets the weighting within the Gradebook. An example use of this aggregation type is when a specific assignment is worth more to the final course grade than others. For example, in our sample activities, <strong>Task 1</strong> and <strong>Task 2</strong> both have a maximum grade of</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>However, <strong>Task 2</strong> might require a lot more detail and research to complete the task and therefore, it should contribute more to the final grade than <strong>Task 1</strong>. With the simple weighted mean aggregation type, the two tasks will be treated equally. However, we can reflect the additional work within the final grade by making use of the weighting option within the weighted mean of grades:</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Categories and items</strong> again.</li>
<li>Change the <strong>Aggregation</strong> type to <strong>Weighted mean of grades</strong>. There are further changes that now need to be made here. Once the weighted mean of grades has been chosen, a new column appears on the <strong>Categories</strong> <strong>and items</strong> page. This is the <strong>Weight</strong> column and it allows us to apply a weight to each graded item. The default for each item is <strong>1.0</strong>. However, in this example, <strong>Task 2</strong> has been changed to a weighting of two in order to reflect the additional work required when completing this activity.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>You can also use the weighted mean of grades to exclude a grade
from the course total. To do this, we will need to change the
weighting to 0.0.</code></pre>
<p><em>Using Calculations</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Change the weighting of <strong>Task 2</strong> to <strong>2.0</strong> and click on <strong>Save changes</strong> at the bottom of the screen.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s see how this affects the final grade:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch back to view the Gradebook. In the drop-down list at the top of the screen, find <strong>View</strong> and click on <strong>Grader report</strong> (or click on <strong>view</strong> in the tab at the top of the Gradebook screen).</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>Chapter 5</code></pre>
<p>The course totals have changed again, so let’s see how this is calculated. In this method of calculating a mean grade, each normalized grade is multiplied by the weight applied to the assessed item. The normalized grades are added together and then divided by the total weights applied to the course. The following table shows you the calculations for this aggregation method for the grades of <strong>Bayley W</strong> :</p>
<pre><code>Task 1 Task 2 Task 3 Total Mean

(.7275*100)</code></pre>
<p>Note that <strong>Task 2</strong> is multiplied by two as this is the weighting we applied for this assessed activity. The mean aggregation is calculated by dividing the total weighted normalized score by four, as this is the total number of weights applied to the course (that is, a weighting of one for <strong>Task 1</strong> , a weighting of two for <strong>Task 2</strong> , and a weighting of one for <strong>Task 3</strong> ).</p>
<p>We have seen three ways of how to calculate a mean grade within a course and customize the Gradebook by choosing to include all assessed activities within the Gradebook rather than just the graded activities. Another popular aggregation method is the sum of grades, which acts differently to the normalized methods already discussed. Let’s have a go with this aggregation method. We will also look at some other customizations available in order to change how the grade is displayed within the Gradebook.</p>
<p><em>Using Calculations</em></p>
<h3 id="example-two-the-sum-of-grades">Example two – The sum of grades</h3>
<p>In this example, we will look at the ‘sum of grades’ aggregation type. The course has five assignments for the students to complete, each with a different final grade.</p>
<p>With the following screenshot, you can see how this example course has been set up:</p>
<p>Note the maximum grades for each assessed activity. The maximum grade for the course is the total of each assessed item within the course.</p>
<p>To change the aggregation type, you will use the same process as the one used previously:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to <strong>Categories and items</strong>.</li>
<li>Change the aggregation type to <strong>Sum of grades</strong> and click on <strong>Save changes</strong> at the bottom of the screen.</li>
<li>Now, switch back to <strong>View</strong> ( <strong>Grader report</strong> in the drop-down list) in the Gradebook.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>Chapter 5</code></pre>
<p>The calculation for this aggregation is simple. Each graded item is added together and presented as the course total grade. Normalization does not occur, and it is not possible to exclude empty grades (ungraded items). This aggregation simply adds each item to the total as it is graded.</p>
<p>However, it is possible to apply some extra credit within this grade type.</p>
<p>Go back to the <strong>Categories and items</strong> page from within the grades area and notice the <strong>Extra credit</strong> column. For each graded item within the course, there is an option for it to be chosen for extra credit. So, what does this do?</p>
<p>Any item that has extra credit applied to it is considered an additional assessment and therefore, the maximum grade is not used in the course total.</p>
<p>For example, the course can have four required tasks. A student might not submit <strong>Task 2</strong> on time or not get a sufficient grade, but they are not allowed to resubmit. <strong>Task 5</strong> could be an additional or alternative task that can be used to increase the final course score. Another use of extra credit could be where the student has completed all work but has the option to improve their final grade by completing additional work.</p>
<p><em>Using Calculations</em></p>
<p>In the example we are using, the course total is currently 360, which is calculated by adding all the maximum grades of each assessed item together. We are going to set <strong>Task 5</strong> as the extra credit. This will mean that the maximum grade of 80 is not included in the calculation of the course total. Let’s apply this; go to the <strong>Categories and items</strong> screen and check the Extra credit column for <strong>Task 5</strong> and click on <strong>Save changes</strong> at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>Note that the course total grade is now 280 instead of 360.</p>
<p>The maximum grade that a student can receive will always be 280. For example, if a student receives a grade of 100 in <strong>Task 1</strong> , 50 in <strong>Task 2</strong> , 30 in <strong>Task 3</strong> , 100 in <strong>Task 4</strong> , and also completes <strong>Task 5</strong> and receives a grade of 80, their course total will still say 280. This is because it is not possible to get a grade that is higher than the course maximum. However, the extra credit will mean that students have an additional chance to receive the highest grade possible.</p>

<h4 id="viewing-letter-grades-in-the-gradebook">Viewing letter grades in the Gradebook</h4>
<p>Until now, we have been viewing the results in the Gradebook as numbers.</p>
<p>In <em>Chapter 2</em> , <em>Customizing Grades</em> , we created letter grades to show numbers as a corresponding word of our choice rather than the numbers that we used to grade (for example, <strong>Distinction</strong> instead of <strong>100</strong> ). We used the following percentages for the grade letters:</p>
<pre><code>Letter grade Highest percentage Lowest percentage
Distinction 100% 100%
Merit 99.99% 75%
Pass 74.99% 50%
Not yet complete 49.99% 0%</code></pre>
<p>If you are following these instructions within your own course, then make sure that you have the letter grades set up, as shown in the preceding table. If you cannot remember how to do this, refer to <em>Chapter 2</em> , <em>Customizing Grades</em>.</p>
<p>We can apply these to our Gradebook so that instead of seeing a final number grade, we will see a word based on the percentage that the learner has received.</p>
<p>This takes some setting up! Take a look:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to the <strong>Grades</strong> area (navigate to <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>Grades</strong> )</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Categories and items</strong> (either by clicking on the drop-down list and clicking on <strong>Simple view</strong> under the <strong>categories and items</strong> heading, or by clicking on <strong>Categories and items</strong> on the tabs bar).</li>
<li>Click on the edit icon at the top of the <strong>Actions</strong> column (this is usually a cog icon, and it will be next to the category aggregation drop-down list).</li>
<li>You need to view the <strong>Category total</strong> options and click on <strong>Show more</strong> to see the settings we need.</li>
<li>Look for the <strong>Grade display type</strong> option. It probably says <strong>Default (Real)</strong> in the current setting. Click on the drop-down list and you will see a range of options. There are three main options: ° <strong>Letter</strong> : This shows you the relevant letter grade in relation to the percentage setup in the letter grades options. ° <strong>Percentage</strong> : This will show you the grade as a percentage. Moodle will calculate the percentage grade based on the grade awarded and the maximum grade possible. ° <strong>Real</strong> : This will show you the actual grade awarded in the grading process. This is what is currently displayed as the default.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Using Calculations</em></p>
<pre><code>You might notice that there are actually more than three options available in
the drop-down list. You will see that more options are there apart from the
ones described in the preceding points. This allows you to choose two grades
to be shown within the Gradebook. For example, if Letter (percentage) is
chosen, the letter will be shown as the main grade in the Gradebook, and
the corresponding percentage will be shown in brackets next to it.</code></pre>
<ol type="1">
<li>From the drop-down list, choose <strong>Letter</strong> and click on <strong>Save changes</strong> at the bottom of the screen.</li>
<li>Switch back to <strong>View</strong> ( <strong>Grader report</strong> in the drop-down list) in the Gradebook.</li>
</ol>
<p>Take a look at the course total and note that the <strong>Course total</strong> column now has the words that have been set up as the letter grades. These are shown based on a calculated percentage grade, which is based on the work graded so far.</p>
<pre><code>Chapter 5</code></pre>
<p>You can see that <strong>Ava B</strong> and <strong>Bayley W</strong> have not yet received sufficient grades to gain an actual grade yet (which means that they have received less than a 50 percent grade according to how our letter grades have been set up). As more work is completed and graded, the course total will increase and therefore the final grade will change.</p>
<p>Note that the tasks are still displayed as real number grades. It is possible to change the settings for individual assignments in order to display alternative grade display types as well. Let’s go in and change these:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go back to <strong>Categories and items</strong>.</li>
<li>This time, click on the edit (cog) icon next to the first graded item on the list (in the example we have been using, this will be <strong>Task 1</strong> ).</li>
<li>Find the <strong>Grade display type</strong> option (you will need to click on <strong>Show more</strong> ) and change it to <strong>Letter</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Save changes</strong> at the bottom of the screen.</li>
</ol>
<p>Repeat this process for all the assessed activities in the course (or as many as you want in order to show a letter grade instead of a number grade). Take a look at the grader report again to see the letter grades instead of numbers shown in the Gradebook.</p>
<p>The process to change the way in which the grades are displayed is the same for all types of aggregation and any graded activity. However, it always needs to be completed through the Gradebook for each individual item, so it could be quite time-consuming for courses with lots of graded items.</p>
<p>If the course is going to use the same grade display types, you can set the course default to an alternative (other than <strong>Real</strong> , which is the current default).</p>
<p><em>Using Calculations</em></p>
<h5 id="setting-the-course-default-for-the-grade-display-type">Setting the course default for the grade display type</h5>
<p>The course default can be set up as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Within the <strong>Grades</strong> screen, we need to go to the <strong>Settings</strong> area (if using the drop-down list, find the <strong>Settings</strong> heading and click on <strong>Course</strong> ; if using the tabs view, click on <strong>Settings</strong> ).</li>
<li>Find the <strong>Grade item settings</strong> section and click on the drop-down list to change the <strong>Default (Real)</strong> option to the option you would like for the course. Save the changes on this screen.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will still be able to change each assignment type or total to an alternative grade display type, but all future graded activities will be presented as this chosen grade display type within the course.</p>
<h3 id="example-three-using-scales">Example three – using scales</h3>
<p>So far, we have been using the Gradebook with number grades (apart from choosing to view these as letter grades). However, courses can also use scales, which are often words used for grading instead of numbers. In <em>Chapter 2</em> , <em>Customizing Grades</em> we set up a word scale for <strong>Not yet complete</strong> , <strong>Pass</strong> , <strong>Merit</strong> , and <strong>Distinction</strong>. When marking as assignment, we pick one of these words as the grade.</p>
<p>Remember that scales have a simple scoring system based on the number of items in the scale rather than true numbers. Therefore, they are not always the best option for complex calculations. However, let’s use some scales in the Gradebook to see the calculations in action.</p>
<p>For this example, there are five tasks within the course, and each one is graded on the <strong>PMD</strong> scale set up in <em>Chapter 2</em> , <em>Customizing Grades</em> (with these options for grading: <strong>Not yet complete</strong> , <strong>Pass</strong> , <strong>Merit</strong> , and <strong>Distinction</strong> ).</p>
<pre><code>Chapter 5</code></pre>
<p>You can see how these have been graded so far in the following screenshot:</p>
<p>The course aggregation for this example has been set to <strong>Sum of grades</strong> , and the Gradebook adds together each grade that is awarded in order to show the course total.</p>
<p>Remember, from <em>Chapter 2</em> , <em>Customizing Grades</em> , the numbers that are used in calculations when using scales are based on the number of items in the scale. In this four-point scale, the grades will be 1 to 4 ( <strong>Not yet complete</strong> = <strong>1</strong> , <strong>Pass</strong> = <strong>2</strong> , <strong>Merit</strong> = <strong>3</strong> , and <strong>Distinction</strong> = <strong>4</strong> ) as the sum of grades is not a normalized scale.</p>
<p>Take a look at <strong>Emilie H</strong> in the previous screenshot. Her course total is 10. This is calculated in the following way:</p>
<p><em>3 (Merit) + 4 (Distinction) +3 (Merit) = 10.</em></p>
<p>Let’s change the aggregation type from <strong>Sum of grades</strong> to <strong>Mean of grades</strong> in the <strong>Categories and items</strong> screen. Also, make sure that the course total at the bottom of the screen says <strong>100.00</strong>. If it does not, then change the number and click on <strong>Save changes</strong> at the bottom of the screen. Go back to the <strong>Grader</strong> view to see how the course total has changed.</p>
<p><em>Using Calculations</em></p>
<p>Take a look at <strong>Emilie H</strong> again. This aggregation method uses a normalization process, and the calculation is shown in the following table. As we know, the scores used with scales will always be based on the number of items in the scale and the Gradebook will always use either 0 or 1 (depending on the aggregation chosen) for the first item in the scale. When using normalized aggregation, methods scales start from 0, so the four-point scale will have a range from 0 to 3 ( <strong>0</strong> = <strong>Not yet complete</strong> , <strong>1</strong> = <strong>Pass</strong> , <strong>2</strong> = <strong>Merit</strong> , and <strong>3</strong> = <strong>Distinction</strong> ).</p>
<pre><code>Task 1 Task 2 Task 3 Total Mean

(0.7778*100)</code></pre>
<p>This process will be the same for all normalized methods (with the aggregation calculation relevant to the method chosen).</p>
<p>In these two examples, the course total has been shown as numbers. However, it is possible to set the course total to use the scale as well.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to the <strong>Categories and items</strong> area in the Gradebook and click on the edit button next to the <strong>Aggregation</strong> drop-down menu.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Category total</strong> section, find the <strong>Grade type option</strong> and choose the scale from the list.</li>
<li>This will activate the <strong>Scale</strong> drop-down list. From this list, choose the <strong>PMD</strong> scale, which is the same scale used for the individual assessments.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Show more</strong> text to view the <strong>Grade display type</strong> options.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>Chapter 5</code></pre>
<ol type="1">
<li>Make sure that the <strong>Grade display type</strong> option says <strong>Real</strong> and <strong>Save changes</strong> at the bottom of the screen.</li>
<li>Now, switch back to <strong>View</strong> the <strong>Grader report</strong> option again.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can see that the course total is now using the same scale as the graded items.</p>
<p>The <strong>Course total</strong> scale uses the same scoring as the individual items and uses the aggregation method to decide which item of the scale is to be displayed.</p>
<p><em>Using Calculations</em></p>
<p>Take a look at <strong>Emilie H</strong> again. Remember that the normalized total was <strong>2.3334</strong>. As two equates to <strong>Merit</strong> in this four-point scale, <strong>Merit</strong> is shown as the course grade. Remember, this example does not use the nongraded assessments in the total, so the grade will change as other assignments are completed. If the normalized grade is calculated as. <strong>5</strong> , the final grade will be rounded up. For example, the normalized grade of <strong>Bayley W</strong> will be <strong>2.5</strong> (a grade of <strong>2</strong> for <strong>Merit</strong> and a grade of <strong>3</strong> for <strong>Distinction</strong> to make a total of <strong>5</strong> .) This, divided by two for the number of grades in the mean calculation, provides the <strong>2.5</strong> normalized total. This is rounded up to display a final course grade of <strong>Distinction</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="example-four-using-outcomes">Example four – using outcomes</h3>
<p>We have seen a range of ways in which Moodle can use numbers, letters, and words to calculate the final course total. We will now look at how the outcomes we set in <em>Chapter 2</em> , <em>Customizing Grades</em> can be used in the course totals.</p>
<p>In this example, two assignment tasks have been set up with no grade but each has different outcomes applied to them. The outcomes are graded using the completion scale set up in <em>Chapter 2</em> , <em>Customizing Grades</em>.</p>
<p>When marking this work, only the outcomes are graded (as either <strong>Not yet complete</strong> , <strong>Partially complete</strong> , or <strong>Complete</strong> ). We will need to tell the Gradebook to include outcomes in the grade aggregation.</p>
<p>For this example, students need to ensure that all the assignment outcomes are complete so a lowest grade aggregation will be used. This is useful as all outcomes need to be marked as complete for the course to be complete. If there is one <strong>Not yet complete</strong> or <strong>Partially complete</strong> grade, this will be shown as the course total and therefore, teachers and students will know that some work still needs to be completed. Once all outcomes are graded as complete, the lowest grade will be <strong>Complete</strong> and this will be shown in the <strong>Course total</strong> column. For these elements to be shown in the course total, the <strong>Course total grade type</strong> option needs to be the ‘complete’ scale. This process requires a running total based on all the required elements, so the aggregation must include nongraded (empty) items in the Gradebook.</p>
<p>There is one new element that needs to be applied here, in addition to settings we have previously used. In the following instructions, only the new step (that is, choosing to include the outcomes in the grade aggregation) will be explained. The other steps will be stated but you will need to use previously learned knowledge (or look back through previous pages) to apply them:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to the <strong>Categories and items</strong> screen.</li>
<li>Change the <strong>Aggregation</strong> type to <strong>Lowest grade</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>Chapter 5</code></pre>
<ol type="1">
<li>Click on the edit icon in the <strong>Actions</strong> column, then click on <strong>Show more</strong> in the <strong>Grade category</strong> section, and remove the tick in the box next to <strong>Aggregate</strong> <strong>only non-empty items</strong>. Also, click on the box to add a tick next to <strong>Include</strong> <strong>outcomes in aggregation</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Category total</strong> section, ensure that the <strong>Grade type</strong> option is set to <strong>Scale</strong> and choose the <strong>Completion</strong> scale from the drop-down list.</li>
<li>Make sure the <strong>Grade display type</strong> option is set to <strong>Real</strong> (we need to click on <strong>Show more</strong> to check this).</li>
<li>Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on <strong>Save changes</strong>.</li>
<li>Then, switch to <strong>View</strong> the full <strong>Grader report</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>When using outcomes, the Gradebook screen has a lot more information in it as each outcome is listed as an additional column on the screen. Using lots of outcomes can make the Gradebook a little difficult to use and will require some scrolling on your screen. However, you can see some of the items that have been graded and the course totals in the following screenshot:</p>
<p>No grade will be shown in the main assignment column ( <strong>Task 2</strong> in the previous example) as it has been set up with no grade, but it has two outcomes (shown with a circle icon) attached to it, which are are graded with a scale. While work is still being submitted and graded, the course total will remain <strong>Not yet complete</strong>. Once a grade has been awarded to all outcomes, the lowest grade will be the one that is shown as the <strong>course total</strong> option. <strong>Emilie H</strong> has submitted all her work and it has been graded, but there is still at least one element that is only partially completed, which is reflected in her course total. However, we can see that <strong>Madeline W</strong> has completed all her tasks, so her course total shows as <strong>Complete</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Using Calculations</em></p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>In this chapter, we saw a range of ways in which the Gradebook can be used to display student grades and calculate final course grades. We saw how numerical grades and scales can be calculated to show a final course grade. We also investigated how the different grading types and aggregation methods can be used.</p>
<p>With many options available within the Gradebook, aggregation types can be quite confusing. However, having worked through the examples, you should now have a better understanding of the key settings related to the calculation of grades within the Gradebook. This should give you an overall understanding of the aggregation types and settings available, and you can also refer to the chapter in the future to apply the settings you need for your course. You can find explanations of each of the category types at Moodle.org: https://docs.moodle.org/27/en/ Category_aggregation</p>
<p>In <em>Chapter 6</em> , <em>Organizing the Gradebook Using Categories</em> , we will see how we can further customize the Gradebook to organize grades into categories.</p>
<h1 id="organizing-the-gradebook">Organizing the Gradebook</h1>
<h1 id="using-categories">Using Categories</h1>
<p>The Gradebook can be difficult to use due to the amount of information shown within the table, especially in a course that uses a lot of graded activities. Often, the main course screen is arranged by topics in order to organize the content, and we can apply a similar process to the Gradebook through the use of categories to group grades by topic, assessment type, or any other preferred arrangement.</p>
<p>We have seen how we can carry out course calculations based on how we want all the assignments to be added together. However, what if you want one set of assessments to be calculated as a mean of grades and another group of tasks to show the highest grade? What if you don’t want some of the grades to be used in the calculations? We can use categories in a range of ways in order to group assessments together, such as by topic or assessment type. We can also use categories to enable some assessments to have a higher weighting than others. In this chapter, we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create categories and learn how to add graded activities to them</li>
<li>See how categories can provide a range of aggregation types within one course</li>
<li>See ways in which we can exclude grades from the final course total</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Organizing the Gradebook Using Categories</em></p>
<h3 id="adding-categories">Adding categories</h3>
<p>Categories enable you to group graded activities within the Gradebook so that they can be viewed together and provide additional options to calculate final course grades. We will look at how they can be used throughout this chapter but first, we need to add some categories. We need to create the categories using the <strong>Grades</strong> area of the course:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the <strong>Grades</strong> area and then go to the <strong>Categories and items</strong> screen (if using the drop-down list, you will need to choose <strong>Simple view</strong> ).</li>
<li>At the bottom of the <strong>Categories and items</strong> screen, there is a button that says <strong>Add category</strong>. Click on this and a new screen will appear.</li>
<li>Give the category a name (such as Unit 1). Note that the options you get when setting up the category are the same as the options we used in <em>Chapter 5, Using Calculations</em> to set up how the course should be aggregated. This includes the grade display type as well as the aggregation method. You can choose the same type of aggregation as the course or use one specific aggregation type for this unit.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Category total</strong> section, you can set a <strong>Maximum grade</strong> option for the category. Category totals will work in exactly the same way as the course total in order to set a maximum grade available. For example, if Unit 1 has three assessments each worth 100 but the maximum for Unit 1 is 100, the maximum grade can be set and the aggregation will take this into account when presenting a final category total. See the upcoming information box for how this affects the course totals.</li>
<li>Make any further changes you would like to make to the category.</li>
<li>When you have added at least one category, you get an additional option at the bottom of the screen in order to choose a <strong>Parent category</strong> option. This allows you to choose whether the category will be a main or a subcategory (a subcategory is a category nested within another category). We will look at the use of subcategories later in the chapter.</li>
<li>Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on <strong>Save changes</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>When using categories, the course total is calculated using the
category totals instead of the individual assessment grades.
The category will complete the selected aggregation when it
is created and present a category total. The course total will
then use each category total in the aggregation that has been
selected for the course total.
Chapter 6</code></pre>
<p>If graded activities have already been added to the course, you can use the <strong>Categories and items</strong> screen to move graded activities to the relevant categories. Once categories have been set up, you can choose the relevant category when initially adding the graded activity to the course.</p>
<p>To move the graded activities into categories, check the small <strong>Select</strong> box next to each activity that you want to move (the <strong>Select</strong> column is on the right-hand side of the screen) and at the bottom of the screen, click on <strong>Move selected items to</strong> and choose the category you would like them to be moved to. You can also use the standard move icon in the <strong>Actions</strong> column to move individual items as required, as shown:</p>
<p>You can also move the order of the categories after they have been created using the moving icon:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Click on the move icon next the category you want to move (in the <strong>Actions</strong> column). This will temporarily remove the category from the screen.</li>
<li>White boxes will appear on the screen in all the places where can move the category to.</li>
<li>Click on the space where you would like the category to be.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Organizing the Gradebook Using Categories</em></p>
<p>In the following screenshot, you can see that there are three categories within the course and there are two aggregation types used in the course:</p>
<p>For this example, the total of <strong>Unit 1</strong> will be calculated using the ‘mean of grades’ aggregation type, which means that the graded items will be divided by 2 (the total number of graded items in the category).</p>
<p><strong>Unit 2</strong> will present the sum of grades (in this case, the total of one assignment) as the category total.</p>
<p><strong>Unit 3</strong> will also show a sum of grades of the two assignments as the category total.</p>
<p>The course total will be <strong>Sum of grades</strong> (as shown at the top of the preceding screenshot), which will add together all the grades awarded and shown in the unit category totals. This calculation will be <em>Unit 1 + Unit 2 + Unit 3</em>. Individual assessment grades will only be included in the final grade if they are not in a category.</p>
<pre><code>Chapter 6</code></pre>
<h3 id="excluding-assessments-from-the-final-grade">Excluding assessments from the final grade</h3>
<p>There might be elements of the online course that are assessed but do not count toward a final grade. These could be formative assessments such as homework activities, quizzes to enable self-assessment, and so on. These graded items will automatically appear in the Gradebook, but you might not want the grades to be counted in the final category or the course total.</p>
<p>There are two main ways in which we can do this. One is to exclude a graded activity for all students and the other is to exclude individual grades for each individual student.</p>
<h4 id="excluding-assessments-from-the-aggregation-for-all-students">Excluding assessments from the aggregation for all students</h4>
<p>There are a few ways in which this can be achieved. One has already been mentioned in <em>Chapter 5</em> , <em>Using Calculations</em> , when using the weighted mean of grades. There are two further ways in which this can be achieved, and both require the use of categories.</p>
<p>If you would like all the graded items that do not count for the course total to be in one category, you can do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to the <strong>Grades</strong> area and then go to the <strong>Categories and items</strong> page (if using the drop-down list, choose <strong>Simple view</strong> under the <strong>Categories</strong> <strong>and items</strong> heading).</li>
<li>Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on <strong>Add category</strong>.</li>
<li>Give the category a name (such as formative assessments or not used for final grade).</li>
<li>Make sure the aggregation is not a sum of grades (any other aggregation method is fine).</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Show more</strong> within the <strong>Category total</strong> section. Find the <strong>Grade type</strong> section and choose <strong>None</strong>.</li>
<li>Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on <strong>Save changes</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any graded activities that are listed in this category will not be included in the course total aggregation.</p>
<p>You can also create the same effect by creating a category with a category total of zero.</p>
<p><em>Organizing the Gradebook Using Categories</em></p>
<p>If you would like to keep the formative assignment and the summative activities within the same category rather than keep all the formative work in a separate category, a subcategory can be used. This enables the graded items to appear together within the Gradebook, but they are not counted in the course total grade. To achieve this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go the <strong>Grades</strong> area and then go to the <strong>Categories and items</strong> page.</li>
<li>Go to the parent category (where you will be adding the subcategory) by clicking on the edit icon next to the category name.</li>
<li>Make sure that there is no tick next to <strong>Aggregate including sub-categories</strong>. It is worth mentioning here that if you are using subcategories and want the grades to be included in the course total, you will need to go into the parent category and check this option.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Save changes</strong> at the bottom of the screen.</li>
<li>Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on <strong>Add category</strong>.</li>
<li>Give the category a name (such as formative assessments or not used for final grade).</li>
<li>Make sure the aggregation is not sum of grades (any other aggregation method is fine).</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Show more</strong> in the <strong>Category total</strong> section and find the <strong>Grade type</strong> section and choose <strong>None</strong>.</li>
<li>At the bottom of the screen, click on the drop-down list next to <strong>Parent</strong> category, and choose the <strong>Parent</strong> category that you created previously.</li>
<li>Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on <strong>Save changes</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Anything moved into this category will not be included in the course aggregation, but it will enable the assignment to be viewed within the Gradebook with the relevant parent category. # Gradebook Glossary of Terms</p>

<p>As done previously, the grade awarded is normalized. However, in this aggregation method, this normalized grade is multiplied by the maximum grade possible for the assessed activity. (In theory, the normalization process is not required in this aggregation type, as the normalization and weighting calculations cancel each other back to the original grade awarded. However, in practice, Moodle always normalizes this aggregation type.) However, the calculation of the mean aggregation is different in this method.</p>
<pre><code>Chapter 5</code></pre>
<p>Instead of dividing the normalized total by the number of grades in the course (in our example, this meant dividing the total by three), the simple weighted mean aggregation divides the normalized total by the total maximum grade possible (which is each of the maximum grades for each activity added together). In this case, it divides the normalized and weighted total by 250.</p>
<p>There is one final method of calculating a mean grade and this requires some additional options to be set by the teacher. Let’s have a go at using the ‘weighted mean of grades’ aggregation method.</p>
<h4 id="the-weighted-mean-of-grades-1">The weighted mean of grades</h4>
<p>In this method, each graded item in the course is manually given a weighting. In the mean of grades method, there is no weighting involved as it is a simple average calculation. In the simple weighted mean of grades, the weighting is based on the maximum grade possible for each graded item. In a weighted mean, the teacher sets the weighting within the Gradebook. An example use of this aggregation type is when a specific assignment is worth more to the final course grade than others. For example, in our sample activities, <strong>Task 1</strong> and <strong>Task 2</strong> both have a maximum grade of</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>However, <strong>Task 2</strong> might require a lot more detail and research to complete the task and therefore, it should contribute more to the final grade than <strong>Task 1</strong>. With the simple weighted mean aggregation type, the two tasks will be treated equally. However, we can reflect the additional work within the final grade by making use of the weighting option within the weighted mean of grades:</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Categories and items</strong> again.</li>
<li>Change the <strong>Aggregation</strong> type to <strong>Weighted mean of grades</strong>. There are further changes that now need to be made here. Once the weighted mean of grades has been chosen, a new column appears on the <strong>Categories</strong> <strong>and items</strong> page. This is the <strong>Weight</strong> column and it allows us to apply a weight to each graded item. The default for each item is <strong>1.0</strong>. However, in this example, <strong>Task 2</strong> has been changed to a weighting of two in order to reflect the additional work required when completing this activity.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>You can also use the weighted mean of grades to exclude a grade
from the course total. To do this, we will need to change the
weighting to 0.0.</code></pre>
<p><em>Using Calculations</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Change the weighting of <strong>Task 2</strong> to <strong>2.0</strong> and click on <strong>Save changes</strong> at the bottom of the screen.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s see how this affects the final grade:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch back to view the Gradebook. In the drop-down list at the top of the screen, find <strong>View</strong> and click on <strong>Grader report</strong> (or click on <strong>view</strong> in the tab at the top of the Gradebook screen).</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>Chapter 5</code></pre>
<p>The course totals have changed again, so let’s see how this is calculated. In this method of calculating a mean grade, each normalized grade is multiplied by the weight applied to the assessed item. The normalized grades are added together and then divided by the total weights applied to the course. The following table shows you the calculations for this aggregation method for the grades of <strong>Bayley W</strong> :</p>
<pre><code>Task 1 Task 2 Task 3 Total Mean

Gradebook

(.7275*100)</code></pre>
<p>Note that <strong>Task 2</strong> is multiplied by two as this is the weighting we applied for this assessed activity. The mean aggregation is calculated by dividing the total weighted normalized score by four, as this is the total number of weights applied to the course (that is, a weighting of one for <strong>Task 1</strong> , a weighting of two for <strong>Task 2</strong> , and a weighting of one for <strong>Task 3</strong> ).</p>
<p>We have seen three ways of how to calculate a mean grade within a course and customize the Gradebook by choosing to include all assessed activities within the Gradebook rather than just the graded activities. Another popular aggregation method is the sum of grades, which acts differently to the normalized methods already discussed. Let’s have a go with this aggregation method. We will also look at some other customizations available in order to change how the grade is displayed within the Gradebook.</p>
<p><em>Using Calculations</em></p>
<h3 id="example-two-the-sum-of-grades-1">Example two – The sum of grades</h3>
<p>In this example, we will look at the ‘sum of grades’ aggregation type. The course has five assignments for the students to complete, each with a different final grade.</p>
<p>With the following screenshot, you can see how this example course has been set up:</p>
<p>Note the maximum grades for each assessed activity. The maximum grade for the course is the total of each assessed item within the course.</p>
<p>To change the aggregation type, you will use the same process as the one used previously:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to <strong>Categories and items</strong>.</li>
<li>Change the aggregation type to <strong>Sum of grades</strong> and click on <strong>Save changes</strong> at the bottom of the screen.</li>
<li>Now, switch back to <strong>View</strong> ( <strong>Grader report</strong> in the drop-down list) in the Gradebook.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>Chapter 5</code></pre>
<p>The calculation for this aggregation is simple. Each graded item is added together and presented as the course total grade. Normalization does not occur, and it is not possible to exclude empty grades (ungraded items). This aggregation simply adds each item to the total as it is graded.</p>
<p>However, it is possible to apply some extra credit within this grade type.</p>
<p>Go back to the <strong>Categories and items</strong> page from within the grades area and notice the <strong>Extra credit</strong> column. For each graded item within the course, there is an option for it to be chosen for extra credit. So, what does this do?</p>
<p>Any item that has extra credit applied to it is considered an additional assessment and therefore, the maximum grade is not used in the course total.</p>
<p>For example, the course can have four required tasks. A student might not submit <strong>Task 2</strong> on time or not get a sufficient grade, but they are not allowed to resubmit. <strong>Task 5</strong> could be an additional or alternative task that can be used to increase the final course score. Another use of extra credit could be where the student has completed all work but has the option to improve their final grade by completing additional work.</p>
<p><em>Using Calculations</em></p>
<p>In the example we are using, the course total is currently 360, which is calculated by adding all the maximum grades of each assessed item together. We are going to set <strong>Task 5</strong> as the extra credit. This will mean that the maximum grade of 80 is not included in the calculation of the course total. Let’s apply this; go to the <strong>Categories and items</strong> screen and check the Extra credit column for <strong>Task 5</strong> and click on <strong>Save changes</strong> at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>Note that the course total grade is now 280 instead of 360.</p>
<p>The maximum grade that a student can receive will always be 280. For example, if a student receives a grade of 100 in <strong>Task 1</strong> , 50 in <strong>Task 2</strong> , 30 in <strong>Task 3</strong> , 100 in <strong>Task 4</strong> , and also completes <strong>Task 5</strong> and receives a grade of 80, their course total will still say 280. This is because it is not possible to get a grade that is higher than the course maximum. However, the extra credit will mean that students have an additional chance to receive the highest grade possible.</p>
<pre><code>Chapter 5</code></pre>
<h4 id="viewing-letter-grades-in-the-gradebook-1">Viewing letter grades in the Gradebook</h4>
<p>Until now, we have been viewing the results in the Gradebook as numbers.</p>
<p>In <em>Chapter 2</em> , <em>Customizing Grades</em> , we created letter grades to show numbers as a corresponding word of our choice rather than the numbers that we used to grade (for example, <strong>Distinction</strong> instead of <strong>100</strong> ). We used the following percentages for the grade letters:</p>
<pre><code>Letter grade Highest percentage Lowest percentage
Distinction 100% 100%
Merit 99.99% 75%
Pass 74.99% 50%
Not yet complete 49.99% 0%</code></pre>
<p>If you are following these instructions within your own course, then make sure that you have the letter grades set up, as shown in the preceding table. If you cannot remember how to do this, refer to <em>Chapter 2</em> , <em>Customizing Grades</em>.</p>
<p>We can apply these to our Gradebook so that instead of seeing a final number grade, we will see a word based on the percentage that the learner has received.</p>
<p>This takes some setting up! Take a look:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to the <strong>Grades</strong> area (navigate to <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>Grades</strong> )</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Categories and items</strong> (either by clicking on the drop-down list and clicking on <strong>Simple view</strong> under the <strong>categories and items</strong> heading, or by clicking on <strong>Categories and items</strong> on the tabs bar).</li>
<li>Click on the edit icon at the top of the <strong>Actions</strong> column (this is usually a cog icon, and it will be next to the category aggregation drop-down list).</li>
<li>You need to view the <strong>Category total</strong> options and click on <strong>Show more</strong> to see the settings we need.</li>
<li>Look for the <strong>Grade display type</strong> option. It probably says <strong>Default (Real)</strong> in the current setting. Click on the drop-down list and you will see a range of options. There are three main options: ° <strong>Letter</strong> : This shows you the relevant letter grade in relation to the percentage setup in the letter grades options. ° <strong>Percentage</strong> : This will show you the grade as a percentage. Moodle will calculate the percentage grade based on the grade awarded and the maximum grade possible. ° <strong>Real</strong> : This will show you the actual grade awarded in the grading process. This is what is currently displayed as the default.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Using Calculations</em></p>
<pre><code>You might notice that there are actually more than three options available in
the drop-down list. You will see that more options are there apart from the
ones described in the preceding points. This allows you to choose two grades
to be shown within the Gradebook. For example, if Letter (percentage) is
chosen, the letter will be shown as the main grade in the Gradebook, and
the corresponding percentage will be shown in brackets next to it.</code></pre>
<ol type="1">
<li>From the drop-down list, choose <strong>Letter</strong> and click on <strong>Save changes</strong> at the bottom of the screen.</li>
<li>Switch back to <strong>View</strong> ( <strong>Grader report</strong> in the drop-down list) in the Gradebook.</li>
</ol>
<p>Take a look at the course total and note that the <strong>Course total</strong> column now has the words that have been set up as the letter grades. These are shown based on a calculated percentage grade, which is based on the work graded so far.</p>
<pre><code>Chapter 5</code></pre>
<p>You can see that <strong>Ava B</strong> and <strong>Bayley W</strong> have not yet received sufficient grades to gain an actual grade yet (which means that they have received less than a 50 percent grade according to how our letter grades have been set up). As more work is completed and graded, the course total will increase and therefore the final grade will change.</p>
<p>Note that the tasks are still displayed as real number grades. It is possible to change the settings for individual assignments in order to display alternative grade display types as well. Let’s go in and change these:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go back to <strong>Categories and items</strong>.</li>
<li>This time, click on the edit (cog) icon next to the first graded item on the list (in the example we have been using, this will be <strong>Task 1</strong> ).</li>
<li>Find the <strong>Grade display type</strong> option (you will need to click on <strong>Show more</strong> ) and change it to <strong>Letter</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Save changes</strong> at the bottom of the screen.</li>
</ol>
<p>Repeat this process for all the assessed activities in the course (or as many as you want in order to show a letter grade instead of a number grade). Take a look at the grader report again to see the letter grades instead of numbers shown in the Gradebook.</p>
<p>The process to change the way in which the grades are displayed is the same for all types of aggregation and any graded activity. However, it always needs to be completed through the Gradebook for each individual item, so it could be quite time-consuming for courses with lots of graded items.</p>
<p>If the course is going to use the same grade display types, you can set the course default to an alternative (other than <strong>Real</strong> , which is the current default).</p>
<p><em>Using Calculations</em></p>
<h5 id="setting-the-course-default-for-the-grade-display-type-1">Setting the course default for the grade display type</h5>
<p>The course default can be set up as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Within the <strong>Grades</strong> screen, we need to go to the <strong>Settings</strong> area (if using the drop-down list, find the <strong>Settings</strong> heading and click on <strong>Course</strong> ; if using the tabs view, click on <strong>Settings</strong> ).</li>
<li>Find the <strong>Grade item settings</strong> section and click on the drop-down list to change the <strong>Default (Real)</strong> option to the option you would like for the course. Save the changes on this screen.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will still be able to change each assignment type or total to an alternative grade display type, but all future graded activities will be presented as this chosen grade display type within the course.</p>
<h3 id="example-three-using-scales-1">Example three – using scales</h3>
<p>So far, we have been using the Gradebook with number grades (apart from choosing to view these as letter grades). However, courses can also use scales, which are often words used for grading instead of numbers. In <em>Chapter 2</em> , <em>Customizing Grades</em> we set up a word scale for <strong>Not yet complete</strong> , <strong>Pass</strong> , <strong>Merit</strong> , and <strong>Distinction</strong>. When marking as assignment, we pick one of these words as the grade.</p>
<p>Remember that scales have a simple scoring system based on the number of items in the scale rather than true numbers. Therefore, they are not always the best option for complex calculations. However, let’s use some scales in the Gradebook to see the calculations in action.</p>
<p>For this example, there are five tasks within the course, and each one is graded on the <strong>PMD</strong> scale set up in <em>Chapter 2</em> , <em>Customizing Grades</em> (with these options for grading: <strong>Not yet complete</strong> , <strong>Pass</strong> , <strong>Merit</strong> , and <strong>Distinction</strong> ).</p>
<pre><code>Chapter 5</code></pre>
<p>You can see how these have been graded so far in the following screenshot:</p>
<p>The course aggregation for this example has been set to <strong>Sum of grades</strong> , and the Gradebook adds together each grade that is awarded in order to show the course total.</p>
<p>Remember, from <em>Chapter 2</em> , <em>Customizing Grades</em> , the numbers that are used in calculations when using scales are based on the number of items in the scale. In this four-point scale, the grades will be 1 to 4 ( <strong>Not yet complete</strong> = <strong>1</strong> , <strong>Pass</strong> = <strong>2</strong> , <strong>Merit</strong> = <strong>3</strong> , and <strong>Distinction</strong> = <strong>4</strong> ) as the sum of grades is not a normalized scale.</p>
<p>Take a look at <strong>Emilie H</strong> in the previous screenshot. Her course total is 10. This is calculated in the following way:</p>
<p><em>3 (Merit) + 4 (Distinction) +3 (Merit) = 10.</em></p>
<p>Let’s change the aggregation type from <strong>Sum of grades</strong> to <strong>Mean of grades</strong> in the <strong>Categories and items</strong> screen. Also, make sure that the course total at the bottom of the screen says <strong>100.00</strong>. If it does not, then change the number and click on <strong>Save changes</strong> at the bottom of the screen. Go back to the <strong>Grader</strong> view to see how the course total has changed.</p>
<p><em>Using Calculations</em></p>
<p>Take a look at <strong>Emilie H</strong> again. This aggregation method uses a normalization process, and the calculation is shown in the following table. As we know, the scores used with scales will always be based on the number of items in the scale and the Gradebook will always use either 0 or 1 (depending on the aggregation chosen) for the first item in the scale. When using normalized aggregation, methods scales start from 0, so the four-point scale will have a range from 0 to 3 ( <strong>0</strong> = <strong>Not yet complete</strong> , <strong>1</strong> = <strong>Pass</strong> , <strong>2</strong> = <strong>Merit</strong> , and <strong>3</strong> = <strong>Distinction</strong> ).</p>
<pre><code>Task 1 Task 2 Task 3 Total Mean

0.7778
(2.3334/3)
77.78
(0.7778*100)</code></pre>
<p>This process will be the same for all normalized methods (with the aggregation calculation relevant to the method chosen).</p>
<p>In these two examples, the course total has been shown as numbers. However, it is possible to set the course total to use the scale as well.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to the <strong>Categories and items</strong> area in the Gradebook and click on the edit button next to the <strong>Aggregation</strong> drop-down menu.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Category total</strong> section, find the <strong>Grade type option</strong> and choose the scale from the list.</li>
<li>This will activate the <strong>Scale</strong> drop-down list. From this list, choose the <strong>PMD</strong> scale, which is the same scale used for the individual assessments.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Show more</strong> text to view the <strong>Grade display type</strong> options.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>Chapter 5</code></pre>
<ol type="1">
<li>Make sure that the <strong>Grade display type</strong> option says <strong>Real</strong> and <strong>Save changes</strong> at the bottom of the screen.</li>
<li>Now, switch back to <strong>View</strong> the <strong>Grader report</strong> option again.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can see that the course total is now using the same scale as the graded items.</p>
<p>The <strong>Course total</strong> scale uses the same scoring as the individual items and uses the aggregation method to decide which item of the scale is to be displayed.</p>
<p><em>Using Calculations</em></p>
<p>Take a look at <strong>Emilie H</strong> again. Remember that the normalized total was <strong>2.3334</strong>. As two equates to <strong>Merit</strong> in this four-point scale, <strong>Merit</strong> is shown as the course grade. Remember, this example does not use the nongraded assessments in the total, so the grade will change as other assignments are completed. If the normalized grade is calculated as. <strong>5</strong> , the final grade will be rounded up. For example, the normalized grade of <strong>Bayley W</strong> will be <strong>2.5</strong> (a grade of <strong>2</strong> for <strong>Merit</strong> and a grade of <strong>3</strong> for <strong>Distinction</strong> to make a total of <strong>5</strong> .) This, divided by two for the number of grades in the mean calculation, provides the <strong>2.5</strong> normalized total. This is rounded up to display a final course grade of <strong>Distinction</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="example-four-using-outcomes-1">Example four – using outcomes</h3>
<p>We have seen a range of ways in which Moodle can use numbers, letters, and words to calculate the final course total. We will now look at how the outcomes we set in <em>Chapter 2</em> , <em>Customizing Grades</em> can be used in the course totals.</p>
<p>In this example, two assignment tasks have been set up with no grade but each has different outcomes applied to them. The outcomes are graded using the completion scale set up in <em>Chapter 2</em> , <em>Customizing Grades</em>.</p>
<p>When marking this work, only the outcomes are graded (as either <strong>Not yet complete</strong> , <strong>Partially complete</strong> , or <strong>Complete</strong> ). We will need to tell the Gradebook to include outcomes in the grade aggregation.</p>
<p>For this example, students need to ensure that all the assignment outcomes are complete so a lowest grade aggregation will be used. This is useful as all outcomes need to be marked as complete for the course to be complete. If there is one <strong>Not yet complete</strong> or <strong>Partially complete</strong> grade, this will be shown as the course total and therefore, teachers and students will know that some work still needs to be completed. Once all outcomes are graded as complete, the lowest grade will be <strong>Complete</strong> and this will be shown in the <strong>Course total</strong> column. For these elements to be shown in the course total, the <strong>Course total grade type</strong> option needs to be the ‘complete’ scale. This process requires a running total based on all the required elements, so the aggregation must include nongraded (empty) items in the Gradebook.</p>
<p>There is one new element that needs to be applied here, in addition to settings we have previously used. In the following instructions, only the new step (that is, choosing to include the outcomes in the grade aggregation) will be explained. The other steps will be stated but you will need to use previously learned knowledge (or look back through previous pages) to apply them:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to the <strong>Categories and items</strong> screen.</li>
<li>Change the <strong>Aggregation</strong> type to <strong>Lowest grade</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>Chapter 5</code></pre>
<ol type="1">
<li>Click on the edit icon in the <strong>Actions</strong> column, then click on <strong>Show more</strong> in the <strong>Grade category</strong> section, and remove the tick in the box next to <strong>Aggregate</strong> <strong>only non-empty items</strong>. Also, click on the box to add a tick next to <strong>Include</strong> <strong>outcomes in aggregation</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Category total</strong> section, ensure that the <strong>Grade type</strong> option is set to <strong>Scale</strong> and choose the <strong>Completion</strong> scale from the drop-down list.</li>
<li>Make sure the <strong>Grade display type</strong> option is set to <strong>Real</strong> (we need to click on <strong>Show more</strong> to check this).</li>
<li>Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on <strong>Save changes</strong>.</li>
<li>Then, switch to <strong>View</strong> the full <strong>Grader report</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>When using outcomes, the Gradebook screen has a lot more information in it as each outcome is listed as an additional column on the screen. Using lots of outcomes can make the Gradebook a little difficult to use and will require some scrolling on your screen. However, you can see some of the items that have been graded and the course totals in the following screenshot:</p>
<p>No grade will be shown in the main assignment column ( <strong>Task 2</strong> in the previous example) as it has been set up with no grade, but it has two outcomes (shown with a circle icon) attached to it, which are are graded with a scale. While work is still being submitted and graded, the course total will remain <strong>Not yet complete</strong>. Once a grade has been awarded to all outcomes, the lowest grade will be the one that is shown as the <strong>course total</strong> option. <strong>Emilie H</strong> has submitted all her work and it has been graded, but there is still at least one element that is only partially completed, which is reflected in her course total. However, we can see that <strong>Madeline W</strong> has completed all her tasks, so her course total shows as <strong>Complete</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Using Calculations</em></p>
<h3 id="summary-1">Summary</h3>
<p>In this chapter, we saw a range of ways in which the Gradebook can be used to display student grades and calculate final course grades. We saw how numerical grades and scales can be calculated to show a final course grade. We also investigated how the different grading types and aggregation methods can be used.</p>
<p>With many options available within the Gradebook, aggregation types can be quite confusing. However, having worked through the examples, you should now have a better understanding of the key settings related to the calculation of grades within the Gradebook. This should give you an overall understanding of the aggregation types and settings available, and you can also refer to the chapter in the future to apply the settings you need for your course. You can find explanations of each of the category types at Moodle.org: https://docs.moodle.org/27/en/ Category_aggregation</p>
<p>In <em>Chapter 6</em> , <em>Organizing the Gradebook Using Categories</em> , we will see how we can further customize the Gradebook to organize grades into categories.</p>
<h1 id="organizing-the-gradebook-1">Organizing the Gradebook</h1>
<h1 id="using-categories-1">Using Categories</h1>
<p>The Gradebook can be difficult to use due to the amount of information shown within the table, especially in a course that uses a lot of graded activities. Often, the main course screen is arranged by topics in order to organize the content, and we can apply a similar process to the Gradebook through the use of categories to group grades by topic, assessment type, or any other preferred arrangement.</p>
<p>We have seen how we can carry out course calculations based on how we want all the assignments to be added together. However, what if you want one set of assessments to be calculated as a mean of grades and another group of tasks to show the highest grade? What if you don’t want some of the grades to be used in the calculations? We can use categories in a range of ways in order to group assessments together, such as by topic or assessment type. We can also use categories to enable some assessments to have a higher weighting than others. In this chapter, we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create categories and learn how to add graded activities to them</li>
<li>See how categories can provide a range of aggregation types within one course</li>
<li>See ways in which we can exclude grades from the final course total</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Organizing the Gradebook Using Categories</em></p>
<h3 id="adding-categories-1">Adding categories</h3>
<p>Categories enable you to group graded activities within the Gradebook so that they can be viewed together and provide additional options to calculate final course grades. We will look at how they can be used throughout this chapter but first, we need to add some categories. We need to create the categories using the <strong>Grades</strong> area of the course:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the <strong>Grades</strong> area and then go to the <strong>Categories and items</strong> screen (if using the drop-down list, you will need to choose <strong>Simple view</strong> ).</li>
<li>At the bottom of the <strong>Categories and items</strong> screen, there is a button that says <strong>Add category</strong>. Click on this and a new screen will appear.</li>
<li>Give the category a name (such as Unit 1). Note that the options you get when setting up the category are the same as the options we used in <em>Chapter 5, Using Calculations</em> to set up how the course should be aggregated. This includes the grade display type as well as the aggregation method. You can choose the same type of aggregation as the course or use one specific aggregation type for this unit.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Category total</strong> section, you can set a <strong>Maximum grade</strong> option for the category. Category totals will work in exactly the same way as the course total in order to set a maximum grade available. For example, if Unit 1 has three assessments each worth 100 but the maximum for Unit 1 is 100, the maximum grade can be set and the aggregation will take this into account when presenting a final category total. See the upcoming information box for how this affects the course totals.</li>
<li>Make any further changes you would like to make to the category.</li>
<li>When you have added at least one category, you get an additional option at the bottom of the screen in order to choose a <strong>Parent category</strong> option. This allows you to choose whether the category will be a main or a subcategory (a subcategory is a category nested within another category). We will look at the use of subcategories later in the chapter.</li>
<li>Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on <strong>Save changes</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>When using categories, the course total is calculated using the
category totals instead of the individual assessment grades.
The category will complete the selected aggregation when it
is created and present a category total. The course total will
then use each category total in the aggregation that has been
selected for the course total.
Chapter 6</code></pre>
<p>If graded activities have already been added to the course, you can use the <strong>Categories and items</strong> screen to move graded activities to the relevant categories. Once categories have been set up, you can choose the relevant category when initially adding the graded activity to the course.</p>
<p>To move the graded activities into categories, check the small <strong>Select</strong> box next to each activity that you want to move (the <strong>Select</strong> column is on the right-hand side of the screen) and at the bottom of the screen, click on <strong>Move selected items to</strong> and choose the category you would like them to be moved to. You can also use the standard move icon in the <strong>Actions</strong> column to move individual items as required, as shown:</p>
<p>You can also move the order of the categories after they have been created using the moving icon:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Click on the move icon next the category you want to move (in the <strong>Actions</strong> column). This will temporarily remove the category from the screen.</li>
<li>White boxes will appear on the screen in all the places where can move the category to.</li>
<li>Click on the space where you would like the category to be.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Organizing the Gradebook Using Categories</em></p>
<p>In the following screenshot, you can see that there are three categories within the course and there are two aggregation types used in the course:</p>
<p>For this example, the total of <strong>Unit 1</strong> will be calculated using the ‘mean of grades’ aggregation type, which means that the graded items will be divided by 2 (the total number of graded items in the category).</p>
<p><strong>Unit 2</strong> will present the sum of grades (in this case, the total of one assignment) as the category total.</p>
<p><strong>Unit 3</strong> will also show a sum of grades of the two assignments as the category total.</p>
<p>The course total will be <strong>Sum of grades</strong> (as shown at the top of the preceding screenshot), which will add together all the grades awarded and shown in the unit category totals. This calculation will be <em>Unit 1 + Unit 2 + Unit 3</em>. Individual assessment grades will only be included in the final grade if they are not in a category.</p>
<pre><code>Chapter 6</code></pre>
<h3 id="excluding-assessments-from-the-final-grade-1">Excluding assessments from the final grade</h3>
<p>There might be elements of the online course that are assessed but do not count toward a final grade. These could be formative assessments such as homework activities, quizzes to enable self-assessment, and so on. These graded items will automatically appear in the Gradebook, but you might not want the grades to be counted in the final category or the course total.</p>
<p>There are two main ways in which we can do this. One is to exclude a graded activity for all students and the other is to exclude individual grades for each individual student.</p>
<h4 id="excluding-assessments-from-the-aggregation-for-all-students-1">Excluding assessments from the aggregation for all students</h4>
<p>There are a few ways in which this can be achieved. One has already been mentioned in <em>Chapter 5</em> , <em>Using Calculations</em> , when using the weighted mean of grades. There are two further ways in which this can be achieved, and both require the use of categories.</p>
<p>If you would like all the graded items that do not count for the course total to be in one category, you can do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to the <strong>Grades</strong> area and then go to the <strong>Categories and items</strong> page (if using the drop-down list, choose <strong>Simple view</strong> under the <strong>Categories</strong> <strong>and items</strong> heading).</li>
<li>Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on <strong>Add category</strong>.</li>
<li>Give the category a name (such as formative assessments or not used for final grade).</li>
<li>Make sure the aggregation is not a sum of grades (any other aggregation method is fine).</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Show more</strong> within the <strong>Category total</strong> section. Find the <strong>Grade type</strong> section and choose <strong>None</strong>.</li>
<li>Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on <strong>Save changes</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any graded activities that are listed in this category will not be included in the course total aggregation.</p>
<p>You can also create the same effect by creating a category with a category total of zero.</p>
<p><em>Organizing the Gradebook Using Categories</em></p>
<p>If you would like to keep the formative assignment and the summative activities within the same category rather than keep all the formative work in a separate category, a subcategory can be used. This enables the graded items to appear together within the Gradebook, but they are not counted in the course total grade. To achieve this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go the <strong>Grades</strong> area and then go to the <strong>Categories and items</strong> page.</li>
<li>Go to the parent category (where you will be adding the subcategory) by clicking on the edit icon next to the category name.</li>
<li>Make sure that there is no tick next to <strong>Aggregate including sub-categories</strong>. It is worth mentioning here that if you are using subcategories and want the grades to be included in the course total, you will need to go into the parent category and check this option.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Save changes</strong> at the bottom of the screen.</li>
<li>Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on <strong>Add category</strong>.</li>
<li>Give the category a name (such as formative assessments or not used for final grade).</li>
<li>Make sure the aggregation is not sum of grades (any other aggregation method is fine).</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Show more</strong> in the <strong>Category total</strong> section and find the <strong>Grade type</strong> section and choose <strong>None</strong>.</li>
<li>At the bottom of the screen, click on the drop-down list next to <strong>Parent</strong> category, and choose the <strong>Parent</strong> category that you created previously.</li>
<li>Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on <strong>Save changes</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Anything moved into this category will not be included in the course aggregation, but it will enable the assignment to be viewed within the Gradebook with the relevant parent category.</p>
