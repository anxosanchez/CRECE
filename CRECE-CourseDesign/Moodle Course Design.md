The Bolonia process became the most important tentative in the world to rationalize higher education system. Developed in Europe with a deadline 2010, represented a new way of understand the learning objectives because put together 25 the higher education systems of 25 European countries with all the trouble that it represented.

A consequence of the unification was the competences based course design, which can be used as a paradigm to design a valuable course in moodle.

The competences were divide into three groups:

1. Generic competences or transferable skills.
2. Subject-specifi competences.
3. The role of a subject as a competence accumulation system.
4. Approaches to learning, teaching, and assessment.
5. The role of quality enhancement in the educational process (emphasizing systems based on internal institutional quality culture)[^1].

## Learning outcomes and competences

The distinction between learning outcomes and competences to distinguish the different roles of the most relevant players:

- Academic staff and students/learners. 
- Desired learning outcomes of a process of learning are formulated by the academic staff, preferably involving student representatives in the process, on the basis of input of internal and external stakeholders. 
- Competences are obtained are developed during the process of learning by the student/learner.
- Learning outcomes are statements of what a learner is expected to know, understand and/or be able to demonstrate after completion of learning. 
- They can refer to a single course unit or module or else to a period of studies.

- Competences represent a dynamic combination of knowledge, understanding, skills and abilities. Fostering competences is the object of educational programmes. Competences will be formed in various course units and assessed at different stages.

Competences can be distinguished in subject specifi c and generic ones. Although Tuning acknowledges to the full the importance of building up and developing subject specifi c knowledge and skills as the basis for
university degree programmes, it has highlighted the fact that time and attention should also be devoted to the development of generic competences or transferable skills. This last component is becoming more and more relevant for preparing students well for their future role in society in terms of employability and citizenship.

Tuning distinguishes three types of generic competences:

- Instrumental competences: cognitive abilities, methodological abilities,
    technological abilities and linguistic abilities;
- Interpersonal competences: individual abilities like social skills (social
    interaction and co-operation);
- Systemic competences: abilities and skills concerning whole systems
    (combination of understanding, sensibility and knowledge; prior ac-
    quisition of instrumental and interpersonal competences required).

In a cycle system each cycle should have its own set of learning outcomes formulated in terms of competences. This can be visualized usingthe following scheess

## Learning outcomes and competences in course design

A  course is not a sum of a number of loosely related course units; it must be handled
as an entity in itself. This requires a more holistic approach. In a student centred-/output-oriented study programme, all units in one way or an other are related to each other. 

Example

| Competence | ABCDE | FGH  | I J  |
| ---------- | :---: | :--: | :--: |
| Unit 1     |   X   |  X   |      |
| Unit 2     |   X   |  X   |  X   |
| Unit 3     |   X   |  X   |  X   |
| Unit 4     |   X   |  X   |  X   |

One of the best ways to start planning your course is by thinking about what you'd like your students to be able to do when they successfully complete it. At the same time, it is good to envision how they should demonstrate their new knowledge or skill. What your students are able to do as a result of taking the course are the learning outcomes of the course. Both terms refer to the notion of a course, that is, focuses not just on the content to be covered, but also on the skills, abilities, beliefs, and attitudes that result upon completion of the course.
