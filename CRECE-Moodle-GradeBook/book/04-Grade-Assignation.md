# Assigning Grades

Once graded activities are added to a Moodle course, we need to award grades to
students. Some of the activities are graded by Moodle, such as quizzes and some
elements of lessons, but activities with a lot of written content need to be reviewed
and graded by the teacher.

## Grading an assignment

Let's first find our way to assignments and the grading screen. Within a course,
we need to click on the name of the assignment that we want to grade. If you created
the assignments based on the instructions within *Chapter 3* , *Adding Graded Activities* ,
click on **Task 1** to view it.

At the top of the assignment screen, we can see the name of the assignment—in
this case, **Task 1** —as well as the assignment details. Beneath the assignment details,
we are provided with a **Grading summary** section. The grading summary tells us
about the following options:

- How many students under the **Participants** option are in the course for
  which we are expecting assignments to be submitted.
- Beneath this, we can see whether any drafts of work have been submitted
  in the **Drafts** section.
- The **Submitted** option tells us how many students have submitted their
  assignment. This is only relevant when students are required to submit
  their work electronically either through file or an online submission.
- The **Needs grading** option tells us how many of the submitted pieces
  of assignments need to be graded. This is particularly useful for teachers
  so that they can quickly see whether they are required to grade any
  assignment without checking each student submission individually.

Underneath the grading summary, there is the **View/grade all submissions** text.
This is a hyperlink that will take us to the assignment grading screen. Click on this
link to go into the assignment grading area.

```
Chapter 4
```

You can see how the grading screen will look in the following screenshot:

There are three main sections on this page:

- The **Grading action** option is shown at the top of the page. This is a
  drop-down list through which you can choose to download assignments
  or select alternative ways of grading.
- The main grading table provides information related to the assessments of
  each student.
- At the bottom of the assignment grading screen is the **Options** section that
  enables us to change how we view the assignment grading screen.

There are a lot of options as well as a lot of information on this screen, so we will
look at one section at a time. The first area we are going to use is in the central table,
as this contains the core information about the assessments for each student. The
table starts with the name of each student on the left-hand side, and each column
provides different details of student submissions and grades. Each column is
explained in the upcoming section.

```
Under the title of each column, there is a – symbol that enables a
user to hide the content of the column. This is useful in order to
provide more usable space. After a column has been collapsed,
we will see a + symbol and enable it to expand it again.
```

*Assigning Grades*

In the following screenshot, the **User picture** and **Email address** columns have been
minimized in order to show more information:

These columns are explained as follows:

- The first column is a **Select** column where we can choose to select student
  rows in order to apply actions to them. The options for the selected rows
  appear beneath the grading table in a drop-down list, as shown in the
  following screenshot:
- There are five options to choose from within the list. All the actions within
  this list can also be undertaken when grading individual assignments, but
  using the **Select** column and choosing an option from the list allows the
  action to be applied to multiple students at the same time. After selecting
  an option, we will click on the **Go** button to complete the action. The five
  options are explained as follows:
  ° **Lock submissions** : This allows a teacher to lock the assignment
  submissions of selected students in order to prevent them from
  amending or changing their work while the grading process is
  taking place.

```
Chapter 4
° Unlock submissions : This allows a teacher to unlock assignments
in order to enable students to amend or re-upload their work.
° Revert the submission back to draft status : This option allows
students to resubmit their work.
° Send feedback files : This option is only available when file
submissions are enabled. The option here allows a teacher to upload
feedback files for students. We will be looking at this when grading
individual assignments, but this option can be used for a quick
upload of feedback files for multiple students.
° Set marking workflow state : This option is only relevant when the
marking workflow has been turned on when creating the assignment.
This enables the teacher to amend the current workflow status of the
assignment for multiple students at the same time.
```

- The next column is the **User picture** column, which is shown in the
  screenshot as a **+** symbol as this has been minimized. This column,
  as suggested, shows you the image a student has uploaded as their
  profile picture. If blind marking has been turned on for the assignment,
  no column for the user's picture will be shown.
- The **First name/surname** column shows you the student's name at the
  beginning of each row. If blind marking is turned on for an assignment,
  a participant number will be shown here instead.
- The **Email address** column shows you the student's email address. In the
  screenshot, this is shown with a **+** symbol, as this has been minimized.
- The **Status** column shows you the submission and grading status of the
  assignment of the student. It will indicate whether a student has submitted
  their assignment (either **No submission** or **Submitted for grading** ). It will
  also show you the grading status ( **Not marked** or **Graded** ).
- The **Grade** column shows you an icon that is used to access the grading
  page for a specific student. After the work has been graded, the currently
  awarded grade will be shown in this column.
- The **Edit** column also enables us to access the assignment grading page
  as well as perform some quick actions for the assignment. The options will
  vary depending on the options chosen when creating the assignment and
  the current status of the assignment. However, the options we are most
  likely to see are:
  ° The **Grade** or **Update grade** option: This takes us to the assignment
  grading page.

*Assigning Grades*

```
° The Prevent submission changes option: This enables us to lock a
student's submission so that it can no longer be changed.
° The Grant extension option: This allows the student to submit their
assignment after the due date but before the cut-off date. This option
is only available if a cut-off date was added when the assignment
was created.
° The Edit submission option: This allows the teacher to upload a file
or add online text on behalf of a student. This option is only shown
prior to students submitting their own assignment.
° The Revert submission to draft option: This is shown if students
have submitted their assignment but it hasn't been graded yet.
Choosing this option will allow the student to submit their
assignment again.
° The Allow another attempt option: This enables the student to have
another go at submitting their work. It will enable regrading by the
teacher following the submission.
```

- The next column on the assignment grading table is the **Last modified**
  **(submission)** column. This will show you the date and time when the
  student submitted their work for grading.
- **File submissions** and/or **Online text** will show a link to the file/files that
  students have uploaded for grading or written into the online text area for
  submission. Teachers can click to view the files from here, or can view them
  from the individual grading screen. For assignments with both online and
  file submissions enabled, there will be two columns.
- **Submission comments** will allow the teacher to view any comments added
  by students while they were submitting their assignment if this option was
  turned on within the assignment.
- The **Last modified (grade)** column will show you the date and time when
  the assignment was graded by a teacher.
- **Feedback comments** will show you the start of any comments given by the
  teacher after the assignment has been graded.
- If an assignment is submitted as a .pdf file, the teacher is given an option
  to grade it using an integrated editor that allows the teacher to review and
  annotate the work directly within Moodle. If this option is used for grading,
  a **View annotated PDF** button will appear within the **Annotate PDF** column.
- **Feedback files** will show you a hyperlink to any files uploaded by the
  teacher to provide feedback to students. This will only be shown if the
  **Feedback files** option was selected when creating the assignment.

```
Chapter 4
```

- The **Final grade** column shows you the grade that was awarded to the student.
- When **Outcomes** are added to an assignment, a column will show you which
  outcomes are being met by the assignment. Following the grading, this
  column will show you the grade for each of the outcomes.

There is a lot of information in this table and it provides a good overview of the
current status of the assignment for each student.

Some grading can take place from this screen, which we will look at in more detail
later, but we will now go to an individual student's grading screen. Click on the
**Grade** icon in the **Status** column next to the student you want to grade (make sure
that you choose a student who has submitted some work). There are three main
sections on the individual grading screen. We will look at each one in turn.

#### The Submission Status section

The **Submission status** section provides a summary of the assignment for this
student, including which attempt this piece of work is, the current submission and
grading status of the piece of work, the date the work was submitted, and access to
any submitted work. The submitted work can be in the form of a hyperlink to a file
or the content of the online submission. For the **Task 1** assignment, students were
required to submit a file for their work, and we can see from the following screenshot
that **Bayley W** has submitted his assignment:

When files are uploaded, the teacher can click on them in order to open them to view
the content.

*Assigning Grades*

#### The Grades section

The **Grade** section will enable us to assign a grade and provide feedback to students,
as shown in the following screenshot:

The first option is to select the grade for the piece of work. The grade will depend on
the type of grade we selected when creating the assignment. For **Task 1** , we selected
**scale grade** , so we are provided with a drop-down list from which we can choose
our grade. When grading this assignment for the first time, the **Grade** drop-down list
will say **No grade**. If this work is being regraded, then the currently assigned grade
will be shown in this list.

```
Chapter 4
```

The next option within the **Grade** section is **Marking workflow state**. This will only
appear if the marking workflow is turned on when initially setting up the assignment.

There are six options that the teacher can choose when they are grading the work:

- **Not marked** : This is the state that will be shown prior to grading.
- **In marking** : This will be chosen if the teacher has started grading the
  assignment but hasn't completed it yet. This option will show other
  teachers that the grading is still in progress. Students won't be able
  to view their grade when this option is chosen.
- **Marking completed** : This option will be chosen when the grading is
  complete, but it should be kept hidden from students. It can be used
  if a teacher has marked this piece of work but is still grading the work
  of others.
- **In review** : This option will be used if the initial teacher or assessor has
  graded the assignment but it needs to undergo a second grading process
  or needs to be moderated inline along with other work.
- **Ready for release** : This option will be chosen if the work has been graded
  and reviewed, where appropriate, and is ready for students to view, but
  we still want to prevent the student from seeing it. This can be used when
  teachers want to release the assignment to all students at the same time but
  they are still in the process of grading other work.
- **Released** : This releases the grades and feedback to students and the grade
  appears within their Gradebook.

The final options within the **Grade** section provide feedback. There were two
options that were selected when we created this assignment: **Feedback comments**
and **Feedback files**. Within the **Feedback comments** section, we can write feedback
for students based on their work. This section has a text editor so that text can be
formatted. Within the **Feedback files** section, we can upload files through the **+** icon
or drag-and-drop them in order to give more information to students. This could be
an annotated copy of the student's original uploaded work, a completed feedback
form, or even a sound file that provides audio feedback.

*Assigning Grades*

#### Attempt settings

The final section of the assignment grading screen outlines the current status and
some further options for the assignment. The details within this section will vary
depending on how the initial assignment was set up. In this example, we opted for
attempts to be reopened automatically, so we are only provided with the details of
this rather than the option that can change it.

Once each of these sections has been completed, we need to save our work. There are
five options at the bottom of the individual grading screen:

- **Save changes** : This enables you to save the grade and feedback and go back
  to the assignment grading table.
- **Save and show next** : This will save the grade and feedback and move onto
  the next individual grading page in order to grade another assignment.

```
Chapter 4
```

- **Cancel** : This will cancel any work completed on the current individual
  grading screen and show you the assignment grading area.
- **Previous** : This will go to the assignment grading screen of the previous
  student in the grading list but will not save any work completed on the
  current grading screen.
- **Next** : This will move on to the next individual grading page but will not
  save any work completed on the current grading screen.

Once the grading has been completed, you will see that the assignment grading table
has been updated. Take a look at **Bayley W** in the following screenshot:

All the information regarding the work of **Bayley W** is explained as follows:

- The **Status** column shows you the text, **Submitted for grading** and
  **Released** which means that not only the work is submitted but has
  also been released after grading.
- A grade is now shown in the **Grade** column as well as in the **Final**
  **grade** column.
- The **Last modified (grade)** column shows you the date and time when
  the grade was last updated.
- You can see the beginning of the written feedback provided in the
  **Feedback comments** column. A magnifying glass icon shown in this
  column enables users to view all the feedback.

When creating the assignment, we enabled offline grading, so let's take a look
at how we access this and some of the other grading options available from the
grading table page.

*Assigning Grades*

#### Grading options

At the top of the assignment grading table page, there is a drop-down list that
provides you with a range of grading options. There are up to five options available
in this list but the options will depend on which options were turned on when the
assignment was created.

These options are explained as follows:

- **Download all submissions** : This enables a teacher to download all the
  files uploaded to this assignment. This will create a .zip file that can be
  used to view all the work when offline.
- **Download grading worksheet** : This option is only available if offline
  grading has been enabled when creating the assignment. It downloads
  a .csv file that contains the assignment information.

```
The file contains current information for assignments that are already graded.
Take a look at Bayley W and note that a grade is already available in column
E and feedback is shown in column K. A teacher can add grades and feedback
into this .csv file while they are offline, and this can be uploaded to populate
the grading table with the relevant grades and feedback.
Chapter 4
```

- **Upload grading worksheet** : We will choose this option if we want to upload
  the amended grading worksheet.
- **Upload multiple feedback files in a zip** : This option allows students' work
  to be annotated and re-uploaded as feedback. This works with the **Download**
  **all submissions** option. After downloading the files, the folder needs to be
  unzipped and all files need to be moved to a new folder. The teacher can then
  review and edit or annotate the files and save them. The file names must not
  be changed. The new folder can then be zipped and uploaded through this
  option. This will assign the relevant feedback files to the relevant students.
- **View gradebook** : This option will take us straight to the Gradebook area in
  order to view all grades for all students.

*Assigning Grades*

#### Options

The **Options** section enables us to customize how the grading table is viewed as well
as provide some quick grading options. Individual teachers can customize how they
view the assignment grading area. Three main options are shown at the bottom of
the assignment grading screen.

These options are explained as follows:

- **Assignments per page** : This option allows us to choose how many rows
  of students are shown per page. For example, if we have 12 students in
  the course, we can choose to view all 12 on one screen rather than move
  to another screen to review the final two students. Alternatively, if students
  are submitting many files per assignment, we might only want to view
  one or two students per page so that we can see all the information easily
  on the screen.
- **Filter** : This is a very useful drop-down list on the grading table that only
  shows you the assignments that we need to consider:
  ° **Not submitted** : This only shows you students who have not
  submitted any work
  ° **Submitted** : This only shows you students who have submitted
  an assignment
  ° **Requires grading** : This option will only show you any assignment
  that is currently ungraded
- **Workflow filter** : This option allows a teacher to choose to view only students
  within a specific part of the workflow. This can be useful to move multiple
  students through the workflow process.

```
Chapter 4
```

- **Quick grading** : A tick in this box will give you an alternative way to grade a
  student's work. Let's look at this in more detail.

#### Quick grading within the assignment grading screen

Turning on the **Quick grading** option turns the assignment grading area into an
editable table that will enable us to add a grade and some written feedback directly
onto the screen without needing to enter individual student pages. Quick grading
is very useful for offline activities or assignments that have already been viewed
offline. When a tick is added to the **Quick grading** box, three columns are changed.

- The **Status** column includes a drop-down list that changes the workflow phase
  for the student (if the marking workflow is turned on for the assignment).
- The **Grade** column also has a drop-down list next to each student in order to
  enable us to choose the grade that we would like to award. This is the same
  drop-down list as the one on the individual grading screen and will show
  you all the options within the scale. If this assignment were to be graded
  with a number, an empty text box would appear here in order to enable
  us to type in the grade to be awarded.
- The **Feedback comments** column also has a text entry box that enables us
  to type in some feedback for the assignment. The feedback box can be made
  larger with the resizing area in the bottom-right section of the box, but there
  is no editor to change how the information looks.

*Assigning Grades*

Once all the grades and written feedback have been added, it is important that you
click on **Save all quick grading changes** at the bottom of the grading table in order
to save the completed feedback. We have now seen most of the main features and
functions of the assignment grading table. However, we created a range of different
type of assignments, so let's take a look at how we can grade other grade types.

#### Grading an online text assignment with a number grade

When creating assignments in *Chapter 3* , *Adding Graded Activities* , we created **Task 2**
in order to enable students to submit text online, and the maximum grade possible
was set to **20**. View Task 2 to follow the instructions for the grading process.

As with the previous assignment, we are initially provided with **Grading summary** ,
and we need to click on **View/grade all assignments**. This will open up the assignment
grading table.

```
Chapter 4
```

The grading table is similar to the one we have already used, but on this table, we
have an **Online text** column instead of a **File submissions** column. Take a look at
your grading table and choose a student who has the **Submitted for grading** text
in the **Status** column. Click on the **grading** icon within the **Grade** column next to
the student's name.

As shown previously, the page begins with some information about the **Submission
status** section. Much of this information is the same as what was used previously,
but take note of the **Online text** information shown on this page. This will allow you
to read the assignment submitted by the student. In most cases, there will be more
text than can be seen on this screen, so a **+** symbol is shown for us to expand the
information in order to read the full submission.

*Assigning Grades*

In the **Submission status** section, we have the **Grade** section, which begins with the
option to assign a grade. For the previous assignment, we graded assignments with
a scale that provided a drop-down list for us to choose the grade. As this assignment
is a number grade, we are provided with a text entry box instead and are informed
to assign a grade in the **Grade out of 20** option. We are not likely to complete this
until we have reviewed the work but when we are ready, we simply need to type
in a number between 0 and 20 in order to assign a grade to the assignment.

Toward the bottom of this section, we can see that the **Feedback comments** box
already has some text in it. This text is the assignment submitted by the student.
This information appears in the box, as we selected **Comment inline** when we
initially created the assignment. We can edit this text and add further information
in order to provide feedback to the students. We will need to make our feedback
stand out from the student's original text, so we will need to make use of the text
editor that is available at the top of the **Feedback comments** box.

```
Chapter 4
```

Click on **Save changes** to submit the feedback and grade to the Gradebook and
inform the student.

So far, we have graded assignments with a scale and number and have viewed
assignments submitted as a file and online text. When creating assignments, we
also set up a third task, which is **Task 3** , that makes use of all of these and utilizes
the **Outcomes** feature. Let's take a look now at how to grade outcomes.

#### Grading an assignment with outcomes

After viewing the assignment and clicking on **View/grade all assignments** , we will
see the assignment grading table. As this assignment has enabled **File submissions**
and **Online text** submissions, both of these columns appear in the table. As we have
added outcomes to this assignment, there is an additional column at the end of the
grading table, which shows you the outcomes that are used.

Note that currently, the text **No outcome** appears with each outcome. This shows
you that the assignments haven't been graded yet.

*Assigning Grades*

We will use the individual grading screen to grade the outcomes, so we need to
click on the **grade** icon in the **Grade** column next to the student whose work we
want to mark.

Once we're on the individual grading screen, the **Submission status** area enables us
to access the file and online text submitted by the student. The **Grade** section is very
similar to the one used previously. A final grade will be awarded and we can enter a
numerical value in the **Grade out of 100** option in the **Grade** box.

However, there are additional items to grade now: **Evidence provided** and **Criteria 1
met**. Next to the name of each outcome is a drop-down list that provides us with the
scale chosen when setting up the outcomes. To grade each outcome, we need to click
on the drop-down list in order to choose the grade we want to provide.

```
Chapter 4
```

The other option we turned on for this assignment, which we haven't seen in practice
yet, is the option to manually reopen an assignment in order to enable resubmission.
This option is within the **Attempt settings** section.

If we want to enable the student to resubmit their work again, we need to change
the **Allow another attempt** option to **Yes** using the drop-down list.

When grading all assignments, we need to ensure that we click on **Save changes**
when we have added the grades and feedback.

We have now looked at all the key options when grading assignments with the
simple direct grading method, and we have also created assignments using the
advanced grading methods that utilize the marking guide and rubric grading
tools. Let's take a look at how to grade these assignments.

### Grading an assignment with a marking guide

If you followed the instructions in *Chapter 3* , *Adding Graded Activities* , open the
assignment titled **Assignment 4**.

The assignment grading table will be the same as the one we have seen previously
with the simple grading method, Click on **View/grade all submissions** and click
on the grade icon next to a student that you want to grade.

*Assigning Grades*

The biggest difference between the grading pages we have seen previously and
using the marking guide is the way in which we grade the assignment. When grading
assignments with a scale, we were provided with a drop-down list in order to add the
grade, and for a numerical grade, we had a textbox to which we could type the grade.
For a marking guide assignment, there is no single grade entry point. Instead, we are
provided with the grading criteria for which we can add a grade. Moodle will then
add each grade together in order to provide the final grade for the assignment.

```
Chapter 4
```

Next to each piece of criteria, there is a text entry box and a score box. Take a look
at the previous screenshot and find the criteria titled **Planning**. The **Grade** section
is explained as follows:

- We can see the full details of the criteria that aids us by providing us with
  the correct grade.
- To the right of this criteria, we have a textbox where we can add feedback
  in relation to this criteria. When creating this assignment, we also added
  some comments in the **Frequently used comments** option, and we can see
  these at the bottom of the marking guide. If we would like to add any of
  these comments to the feedback, we need to click on the box where we
  want to add the comment and then click on the **+** symbol next to the
  frequently used comment that we want to use.
- The final column on the right-hand side provides a grade entry box.
  Underneath this box, we can see the maximum number of points that
  are available for this criteria. To provide a grade, we add a number
  grade up to the given maximum grade.

Like the simple grading methods, we also have the option to add general feedback, and
we can also have options to change the marking workflow and reopen submissions
depending on how the assignment was set up.

After adding the feedback and individual criteria grades, we need to click on the
**Save changes** button.

Following the grading, each score assigned to each piece of criteria is added together
in order to provide the final grade for the student, and this can be seen in the **Grade**
column in the assignment grading table.

The student will see the final grade and each individual criteria grade and feedback
when reviewing the feedback for their assignment.

The final type of grading that we set up in *Chapter 3* , *Adding Graded Activities* , was
through the use of a rubric. Grading with a rubric is similar to using a marking
guide. Let's take a look at this together.

*Assigning Grades*

### Grading an assignment with a rubric

If you created **Assignment 5** , click to view this now and make your way to the
grading screen of a selected student. Much like the marking guide, instead of
a single grade entry point, we have a table that provides us with the criteria for
the assignment. However, unlike the marking guide, we will not be grading
with a numerical grade of our choice.

The rubric table enables us to easily grade work even though there is a lot of
information on the screen.

When grading assignments, the teacher reviews the work and clicks on the box
that contains the statement and points that they want to award. We can also
add written feedback in the textbox on each row. A section to add in the overall
feedback is also available.

```
Chapter 4
```

In the following screenshot, you can see how this rubric grid has been completed by
the teacher:

The shaded boxes show you the grade awarded for each criterion, and some comments
have been added to the feedback column as well.

The final grade for the assignment is calculated by Moodle by adding together each
of the points awarded within the rubric, and this is shown in the assignment grading
table within the Grade column.

As with the marking guide, the student will see the full rubric table and comments
when they receive their assignment feedback.

*Assigning Grades*

### Grading a graded item within the Gradebook

We have seen how we can grade assignments by accessing the activities from within
the main course screen. However, in *Chapter 3* , *Adding Graded Activities* , we also added
a graded activity directly into the Gradebook. So, how do we grade this? We go into
the Gradebook! Let's take a look:

1. From the main course screen, go to the **Grades** area (navigate to
   **Administration** | **Grades** ).
2. Click on the **Turn editing on** button in the top-right corner of the screen.
3. We will be able to add a grade directly into the graded item.

In the previous screenshot, you can see the **Attendance grade** option. This item was
set up as a value grade. To add the grade, we type a number into the empty textbox.
At the bottom of the screen, there is an **Update** button that saves any grades that we
have added.

```
Chapter 4
```

We can also use this grading method for any other type of graded activity within
the Gradebook.

#### Quick grading within the Gradebook

Turning editing on within the **Grades** area will allow us to grade any graded activity.

In the previous screenshot, we can see different types of grades. **Task 1** is an example
of an assignment that is graded with a scale and, therefore, quick grading provides
a drop-down list that enables us to choose the grade we would like to award. **Task
2** and **Task 3** , however, have been set as numerical grades, so we need to type the
number into the grade box. Also, as part of **Task 3** , there are two columns that show
you outcomes that are graded using a drop-down list that chooses a scale item.

After we have amended grades on this screen, we need to click on the **Update** button
to save the grades.

There are a few things to consider when using quick grading:

- We cannot see the maximum grade when adding number grades.
- The marking guide and rubric-graded assignments cannot be marked
  via the quick grading option.

*Assigning Grades*

When using the quick grading option, we can choose to add quick feedback, but this
option is not shown on the current screen. However, we can change some settings to
enable this:

1. Click on the **My preferences** tab, or click on **Grader report** under the
   **My preferences** heading.
2. Scroll to the **General** section at the bottom of the page.
3. Next to the **Show quick feedback** text, change the drop-down list to **Yes**.
4. Click on the **Save changes** button at the bottom of the page.

The quick feedback option is limited to adding text, so if a lot of text is required,
it is recommended that the individual grading screen be used.

### Summary

In this chapter, we have seen how to grade assignments that have number or scale
grades and graded outcomes, and we used the marking guide and rubric grading
forms. We also saw how we can use the quick grading options within the assignment
area and the Gradebook screen.

We saw how we can grade individual assignments, but how do all of these come
together in the Gradebook? In the next chapter, we will look at how the grades can
work together in the Gradebook and how calculations can be set up to calculate the
final course grades. We will also see how we can further customize the Gradebook.



In *Chapter 6* , *Organizing the Gradebook Using Categories* , we will see how we can further
customize the Gradebook to organize grades into categories.

# Organizing the Gradebook

# Using Categories

The Gradebook can be difficult to use due to the amount of information shown
within the table, especially in a course that uses a lot of graded activities. Often,
the main course screen is arranged by topics in order to organize the content, and
we can apply a similar process to the Gradebook through the use of categories to
group grades by topic, assessment type, or any other preferred arrangement.

We have seen how we can carry out course calculations based on how we want
all the assignments to be added together. However, what if you want one set of
assessments to be calculated as a mean of grades and another group of tasks to
show the highest grade? What if you don't want some of the grades to be used
in the calculations? We can use categories in a range of ways in order to group
assessments together, such as by topic or assessment type. We can also use
categories to enable some assessments to have a higher weighting than others.
In this chapter, we will:

- Create categories and learn how to add graded activities to them
- See how categories can provide a range of aggregation types within
  one course
- See ways in which we can exclude grades from the final course total

*Organizing the Gradebook Using Categories*

### Adding categories

Categories enable you to group graded activities within the Gradebook so that they
can be viewed together and provide additional options to calculate final course
grades. We will look at how they can be used throughout this chapter but first, we
need to add some categories. We need to create the categories using the **Grades** area
of the course:

- Go to the **Grades** area and then go to the **Categories and items** screen
  (if using the drop-down list, you will need to choose **Simple view** ).
- At the bottom of the **Categories and items** screen, there is a button that
  says **Add category**. Click on this and a new screen will appear.
- Give the category a name (such as Unit 1). Note that the options you
  get when setting up the category are the same as the options we used in
  *Chapter 5, Using Calculations* to set up how the course should be aggregated.
  This includes the grade display type as well as the aggregation method.
  You can choose the same type of aggregation as the course or use one
  specific aggregation type for this unit.
- In the **Category total** section, you can set a **Maximum grade** option for the
  category. Category totals will work in exactly the same way as the course
  total in order to set a maximum grade available. For example, if Unit 1 has
  three assessments each worth 100 but the maximum for Unit 1 is 100, the
  maximum grade can be set and the aggregation will take this into account
  when presenting a final category total. See the upcoming information box
  for how this affects the course totals.
- Make any further changes you would like to make to the category.
- When you have added at least one category, you get an additional option
  at the bottom of the screen in order to choose a **Parent category** option. This
  allows you to choose whether the category will be a main or a subcategory
  (a subcategory is a category nested within another category). We will look
  at the use of subcategories later in the chapter.
- Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on **Save changes**.

```
When using categories, the course total is calculated using the
category totals instead of the individual assessment grades.
The category will complete the selected aggregation when it
is created and present a category total. The course total will
then use each category total in the aggregation that has been
selected for the course total.
Chapter 6
```

If graded activities have already been added to the course, you can use the **Categories
and items** screen to move graded activities to the relevant categories. Once categories
have been set up, you can choose the relevant category when initially adding the
graded activity to the course.

To move the graded activities into categories, check the small **Select** box next to each
activity that you want to move (the **Select** column is on the right-hand side of the
screen) and at the bottom of the screen, click on **Move selected items to** and choose
the category you would like them to be moved to. You can also use the standard
move icon in the **Actions** column to move individual items as required, as shown:

You can also move the order of the categories after they have been created using the
moving icon:

1. Click on the move icon next the category you want to move (in the **Actions**
   column). This will temporarily remove the category from the screen.
2. White boxes will appear on the screen in all the places where can move the
   category to.
3. Click on the space where you would like the category to be.

*Organizing the Gradebook Using Categories*

In the following screenshot, you can see that there are three categories within the
course and there are two aggregation types used in the course:

For this example, the total of **Unit 1** will be calculated using the 'mean of grades'
aggregation type, which means that the graded items will be divided by 2 (the total
number of graded items in the category).

**Unit 2** will present the sum of grades (in this case, the total of one assignment) as the
category total.

**Unit 3** will also show a sum of grades of the two assignments as the category total.

The course total will be **Sum of grades** (as shown at the top of the preceding
screenshot), which will add together all the grades awarded and shown in the unit
category totals. This calculation will be *Unit 1 + Unit 2 + Unit 3*. Individual assessment
grades will only be included in the final grade if they are not in a category.

```
Chapter 6
```

### Excluding assessments from the final grade

There might be elements of the online course that are assessed but do not count
toward a final grade. These could be formative assessments such as homework
activities, quizzes to enable self-assessment, and so on. These graded items will
automatically appear in the Gradebook, but you might not want the grades to be
counted in the final category or the course total.

There are two main ways in which we can do this. One is to exclude a graded
activity for all students and the other is to exclude individual grades for each
individual student.

#### Excluding assessments from the aggregation for all students

There are a few ways in which this can be achieved. One has already been mentioned
in *Chapter 5* , *Using Calculations* , when using the weighted mean of grades. There are
two further ways in which this can be achieved, and both require the use of categories.

If you would like all the graded items that do not count for the course total to be in
one category, you can do the following:

1. Go to the **Grades** area and then go to the **Categories and items** page
   (if using the drop-down list, choose **Simple view** under the **Categories**
   **and items** heading).
2. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on **Add category**.
3. Give the category a name (such as formative assessments or not used
   for final grade).
4. Make sure the aggregation is not a sum of grades (any other aggregation
   method is fine).
5. Click on **Show more** within the **Category total** section. Find the **Grade type**
   section and choose **None**.
6. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on **Save changes**.

Any graded activities that are listed in this category will not be included in the
course total aggregation.

You can also create the same effect by creating a category with a category total of zero.

*Organizing the Gradebook Using Categories*

If you would like to keep the formative assignment and the summative activities within
the same category rather than keep all the formative work in a separate category, a
subcategory can be used. This enables the graded items to appear together within the
Gradebook, but they are not counted in the course total grade. To achieve this:

1. Go the **Grades** area and then go to the **Categories and items** page.
2. Go to the parent category (where you will be adding the subcategory)
   by clicking on the edit icon next to the category name.
3. Make sure that there is no tick next to **Aggregate including sub-categories**.
   It is worth mentioning here that if you are using subcategories and want the
   grades to be included in the course total, you will need to go into the parent
   category and check this option.
4. Click on **Save changes** at the bottom of the screen.
5. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on **Add category**.
6. Give the category a name (such as formative assessments or not used
   for final grade).
7. Make sure the aggregation is not sum of grades (any other aggregation
   method is fine).
8. Click on **Show more** in the **Category total** section and find the **Grade type**
   section and choose **None**.
9. At the bottom of the screen, click on the drop-down list next to **Parent**
   category, and choose the **Parent** category that you created previously.
10. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on **Save changes**.

Anything moved into this category will not be included in the course aggregation,
but it will enable the assignment to be viewed within the Gradebook with the
relevant parent category.

#### Excluding assessments from the aggregation for individual students

If you only want to exclude some grades for some students, you can do this for each
individual student for each graded activity:

1. Go to the **Grades** area to view **Grader report** (navigate to **Administration** |
   **Grades** ).
2. In the top-right corner, click on **Turn editing on**.

```
Chapter 6
```

1. Once editing is turned on, the edit icon will appear next to each individual
   graded item (it doesn't matter whether the work has been graded yet or not).
2. Click on the edit icon next to the activity that you would like to exclude from
   the aggregation.
3. A screen will appear with an option of **Excluded** as shown in the following
   screenshot. Click on the box next to this option to add a tick to the box.
4. Scroll to the bottom of the screen to click on **Save changes**.

These methods work with all aggregation types except the sum of grades. The sum of
grades will always include all grades in the final aggregation. If you are using **Sum of
grades** , a warning appears next to the **Excluded** option, reminding the user about this:
**excluding of grades is not compatible with sum aggregation**.

### Summary

In this chapter, we saw some ways in which the Gradebook can be organized in order
to make it easier to use through the use of categories. Apart from grouping graded
items together, categories can also be used to further increase the options for grade
calculations by choosing the graded items in a category that will not be included in the
final grade. We also saw how to exclude individual grades from the final course total.

In the next chapters, we will look at how we can use the information in the Gradebook
to report and review students' achievements.

# Reporting with the

# Gradebook

So far, we have seen how we can use number, letter, and scale grades and how we can
add assignments to courses. We can grade assignments and set up the Gradebook to
calculate course totals.

We will now look at how we can view reports for all students as well as for individual
students and some of the other ways in which the grade reports can be customized and
exported. There are four main reports:

- The grader report
- The outcomes report
- The overview report
- The user report

### The grader report

We have already seen the grader report a few times throughout this book, as it is the
main screen we see when we go into the Gradebook.

To get to the grader report, we go to the **Grades** area:

1. Click on **Grades** in the **Administration** block.
2. If you are using the tabs layout, make sure that the **View** tab and **Grader**
   report are selected. If you are using the drop-down list to navigate the
   **Grades** area, ensure that the **Grader report** option under the **View**
   heading is selected.

*Reporting with the Gradebook*

You can see the tabs and the drop-down menu in the following screenshot:

This report shows you the grades of all the students for each graded activity.
This enables the teacher to see the progress of all students in one place.

The report shows you one student per row. For courses with many students, the
student rows might appear over two or more pages. In this case, a **Next** button will
appear to move to the next page of students. However, we can change how many
students are shown per page within the Gradebook preferences. If you have tabs
at the top of your screen, click on **Preferences**. If you're using the drop-down list,
choose **Grader report** under the **Preferences** heading. Within the **General** section,
there is an option to type in how many students per page you would like to view.
Click on **Save changes** to save this option.

Within each column, we can see the grade for each assignment. However, with a lot
of graded activities in the course, the grader report can be very wide. Categories can
be used to organize this content, but the grader report also lets us collapse information
to make it even easier to view.

```
Chapter 7
```

There are three main ways to collapse the information. The following screenshot shows
you two rows of grades (for two different students), and there are three categories set
up for this course ( **Unit 1** , **Unit 2** and **Unit 3** ), as shown in the top row. Each category
is displayed in a different way.

**Unit 1** has a **–** symbol next to it. This is the default way of viewing the category and
grade information, and it shows you the full expanded view of grades. It shows you
each graded activity within the category (in this case, **Task 1** and **Task 2** ) and the
**Category total** column.

**Unit 2** has a **+** symbol next to it. This shows you a collapsed view of the category,
and only shows you the **Category total** column and not the graded activities that
are in that category.

**Unit 3** has a square-based symbol next to it, and this shows you the graded activities
within the category but not the **Category total** column.

You can click on these symbols next to each category to toggle between each view.
The changes are made for the individual user and will be remembered each time
the user views the grader report. You can change the way the report is viewed at
any time.

```
The theme of the Moodle site might show alternative icons
to expand and collapse the category views.
```

A useful option for courses that have a lot of graded activities is to view the **Category
total** column only (so that the **+** symbol is displayed). This will show you all the
category totals in the course so that the grader report is not too detailed. The user can
then choose to view the full content of the category they are using at that point in time
(such as the current unit being delivered).

*Reporting with the Gradebook*

This is particularly useful for courses where different teachers teach different
units, as they can collapse the categories so that they only view the category
that they teach.

Another issue with a course that has a lot of content is related to having a lot of
students in the course. This can make the table very long and can be a particular
issue if there are a number of course groups that use the same online course.
Again, different teachers might grade different groups of students. However,
we can set up groups to enable teachers to only view the students they want.

#### Using groups to further improve the Gradebook's use

Groups are a course-wide feature, but this section will give you a quick overview
of how to set them up and use them within the Gradebook.

There are three elements that we need to address:

- Creating groups and adding students to groups
- Setting the assignments to enable group views
- Changing the course settings to view groups in the Gradebook

##### Creating groups

The following steps shows how to create a group in the Gradebook:

1. Go to the main screen of the course and view the **Administration** block.
   Choose **Users** and click on **Groups**.
2. At the bottom of this screen, click on **Create group**.
3. Type in the name of the group (such as Group A) and click on **Save changes**
   at the bottom of the screen. Repeat this process for each group required.
4. After the groups have been created, they will appear in the groups list on
   the left-hand side of the screen. Click on the first group in the list so that
   it is highlighted and then click on **Add/remove users** in the bottom-right
   corner of the screen.
5. In the right-hand column on the screen, all current members of the course will
   appear. Choose the students who should be part of this group by clicking on
   their name and then clicking on **Add** in the centre of the two columns. Repeat
   this process for each student.

```
Chapter 7
```

1. Once the process is complete, click on **Back to groups** at the bottom of the
   screen. Repeat this process for other groups.

##### Enabling assignments to use groups

Each assignment that we want to be able to grade in groups has to be set up to enable
the use of groups.

This is chosen in the common module settings of the assignment editing screen.
This can be done when we initially set up the assignments:

1. When viewing the assignment on the screen, click on **Edit settings** in the
   **Administration** block.
2. Find the **Common modules settings** section and click on the title to display the
   options. Find the **Group mode** option and change the option from **No groups**
   to **Visible groups** or **Separate groups** and **Save and display** the assignment.

*Reporting with the Gradebook*

1. View the assignment and feedback grading area from within the assignment
   by clicking on the **View/grade all submissions** text.
2. In the top-left section of the assignment area, you will now see a **Visible**
   **groups** or **Separate groups** drop-down list.

You can use this drop-down list to choose the group that you would like to view.
This will filter the students and show only the students in the chosen group. You
can still view all participants to see all the students on the grading screen.

##### Viewing the groups in the Gradebook

If we want to view these groups in the grader report, we need to change the course
settings:

1. From the main course screen, go to the **Administration** block and click on
   **Edit settings** under the **Course administration** heading.
2. Scroll down the page and click on the **Groups** option. Change **Group**
   **mode** to **Visible groups** or **Separate groups**.
3. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on **Save changes**.
4. From the **Administration** block, click on **Grades** to go back to the
   **Grader report**.
5. You will notice that the **Visible groups** or **Separate groups** drop-down
   lists are now available at the top of the grader report. Teachers can filter
   to view groups of students or view all students along with the relevant
   course grades.

Apart from showing assignment grades for each student, the grader report will also
show the outcome grade. However, as the grader report has a lot of information, it can
be difficult for the teacher to see whether each outcome is being achieved throughout
the whole course. The outcomes report provides a summary of the outcomes used in
the course and shows the average outcome grades for the course based on the outcome
grades given to date.

```
Chapter 7
```

### Outcomes report

The outcomes report is used in courses where outcomes have been added to
the course. Details of how to enable and add outcomes are provided in *Chapter 2* ,
*Customizing Grades*. If you have tabs at the top of your screen, click on **View** and
then click on the **Outcomes report** under the tabs. If you're using the drop-down
list, choose **Outcomes report** under the **View** heading.

The outcomes report can help the teacher see which outcomes are being achieved
and at what level; it also helps them see which ones might require additional support
or development.

This previous report lists the three outcomes that have been used within this course.
These are shown in the first column with the **Short name** title.

The second column shows you the average grade for each outcome. This average is
based on the grades awarded for the outcome divided by the number of times this
outcome has been graded. The average is shown in the same scale, as the outcome is
graded but the number in brackets is the equivalent number value. Remember that
the numbers used by scales are based on the number of items in the scale. In this
example, there are three options in the scale ( **Not yet complete** , **Partially complete** ,
and **Complete** ), which means that the maximum number will be three. The average
for **Evidence provided** is **2.17** and therefore, it will display the **Partially complete**
scale value as this is item number two in the scale list.

The **Site-wide** column will state **Yes** or **No** , depending on whether the outcome is
used in this course only (in which case, it will say **No** ) or whether the outcomes are
used throughout the Moodle site (in which case, it will say **Yes** ).

*Reporting with the Gradebook*

The final three columns provide additional details for how the outcomes are used.
The **Activities** column shows you each activity that has this outcome assigned.
The **Average** column will show you the average grade for the task, and the final
**Number of grades** column shows you how many grades this average is based on.

### Overview report

The next report that is available is the overview report. (If you have tabs at the top of
your screen, click on **View** and then click on the **Overview report** under the tabs. If
you're using the drop-down list, choose **Overview report** under the **View** heading.)
This can be accessed from any course, but it enables a teacher to view the current
course totals of each student for all the courses in which they are currently enrolled
on Moodle.

After clicking on **Overview report** , a list of courses will appear, but the first step
is to choose a user or student for whom we want to see the current course results.
This drop-down list appears on the right-hand side next to **Select a user**.

Once a user has been chosen, the course list will change and display all the courses
that the chosen student is enrolled in, and the grade column will show the current
grade awarded for each course.

The current grade shows the same grade that appears in the **Course total** column of
the grader report for each individual course. This grade is likely to change throughout
the duration of the course.

The overview report enables teachers to view students' progress across a number of
Moodle courses without having to visit each course individually. However, the teacher
can choose to review the details of an individual student's progress by clicking on the
**Course name** option in the overview list. This will show you the user report of the
learner for the chosen course.

```
Chapter 7
```

### User report

You can access the user report in the same way as the grader and overview reports.
If you're using the drop-down list, find the **View** heading and click on **User report**.
If you're using the tabs menu, click on **View** , and then click on **User report** , which
is shown under the tabs.

Like the overview report, the user report requires the teacher to choose a user from
the drop-down list on the right-hand side (unless the user report is accessed via the
overview report or by clicking on the grades icon next to the student's name in the
grader report).

The user report will show you each graded activity in the course along with the current
grade awarded for each activity and the feedback given. This has the same information
as the grader report, but this information is for an individual student. It also presents
the information in a portrait rather than landscape format (the following screenshot
only has a few activities within the Gradebook, but for courses with a lot of graded
activities, the page will be longer).

*Reporting with the Gradebook*

The user report shows you each graded activity from the course in the **Grade item**
column with the current **Grade** value awarded next to it. Finally, the **Feedback**
column shows you any written feedback given for the activity. If we click on the
name of the activity, we can access the full assessment information.

The final row of the column shows you the **Course total** grade so far. This is the
same information as what is shown in the **Course total** column in the grader report
and in the overview report. In the previous screenshot, this is **48.11**.

### Reports that students see

A student can access the Gradebook in the same way as a teacher. They will click on
**Grades** in the **Administration** block.

When a student views their grades, it is their own user report that they will see.
Students can also view the overview report. Both reports look the same for the
students as they do for the teacher. However, they can only see their own reports,
whereas a teacher can view the reports for all students in the course.

```
By default, the Gradebook is available for students to view. If you
would like to turn off access to the grades for students, you can do
this in the course settings. Go to the Administration block and click
on Edit settings under the Course Administration heading. Click
on the Appearance title and find the Show gradebook to students
option and change it from Yes to No.
```

### Customizing the reports view

We have seen how the grader, outcomes, overview, and user reports can be used
and the information that can be shown on each. The information shown in the
screenshots used is based on the default settings of each report. However, each
of the reports can also be customized to change the information shown.

Within the **Grades** area of the course, there is a **Settings** section that can be used
to change how each report is viewed in the course.

This is accessed through the **Settings** tab (if using the tabs layout) or by clicking
on the drop-down list. Find the **Settings** heading and click on **Course** (if using the
drop-down list option).

```
Chapter 7
```

A range of options are available for each report type, as shown in the following
screenshot:

*Reporting with the Gradebook*

Change the settings to meet your needs and click on **Save changes** at the bottom of the
screen. These settings will be applied to the course rather than the individual user.

```
Try changing the settings to see how they can customize
your Gradebook and meet your needs.
```

### Exporting the Gradebook data

Apart from viewing the data within Moodle, it is possible to export the Gradebook
data and download it to view and use offline. There are four options that are
available to download it:

- An OpenDocument spreadsheet
- A plain text file
- An Excel spreadsheet
- An XML file

You access these options from the **Grades** area in Moodle in the same way as you
access the reports. How you access the export options will depend on whether you are
using the drop-down menu or tab navigation within the **Grades** area. Both options
are shown in the following screenshot. If you're using the drop-down menu, find the
**Export** heading and click on **OpenDocument spreadsheet** (you can also choose other
export options from here). If you're using the tabs layout, click on the **Export** tab.
Within the export tab, a second row of options appears, which provides you with the
export options.

```
Chapter 7
```

Once you are on the export screen, a range of options are available for you to choose
the information to be exported and downloaded.

*Reporting with the Gradebook*

These options are explained as follows:

- **Include feedback in export** : This includes the written feedback alongside
  the exported data. To include this, we need to click on the box to add a tick.
- **Exclude suspended users** : This is chosen as the default so that only active
  students are in the exported report. However, if you have any users in the
  course who have been assigned as suspended but require the data, we will
  need to remove this tick.
- **Preview rows** : This allows us to choose the number of rows of student data
  that will be shown once the options are submitted. This allows the teacher
  to check the data to ensure that it displays the information required before
  finally exporting the information.
- **Grade export display type** : With this, the teacher can choose whether the
  real, percentage, or letter grade is the grade shown in the exported data
  and how many decimal points are shown with the **Grade export decimal**
  **points** option.
- **Grade items to be included** : With this, the second part of the options will
  display all the graded activities, category totals, and the course totals that
  are included in the online course. The teacher can choose which elements
  they would like in the exported data. For example, a teacher might only
  want to export the data for their own unit. A tick in the box will indicate
  that the data is to be exported. All items will be ticked by default. Clicking
  on the tick will remove the tick and therefore, will not include the data in
  the export.
- Click on **Submit** to start the export process.

After clicking on **Submit** , a preview screen will appear with a **Download** button on it.

The **Download** button will download the chosen Gradebook data in the
selected format.

```
Chapter 7
```

### Summary

In this chapter, we saw the range of ways in which the Gradebook can be used and
customized to display the data required for both teachers and students.

Teachers can see all student grades and individual user data as well as set up groups to
aid the marking and review process. Students and teachers can also see an overview of
all the courses that a user is enrolled on to see the current final grade for each course.

These reports provide the main options to view grades. However, there are a few
further customizations that can aid the progress tracking. The final chapter will
outline some of these options to further enable the tracking of students' progress.

# Additional Features for

# Progress Tracking

The Gradebook is a very useful tool to manage the progress of students. It enables
teachers to review and manage the grades awarded for each graded activity in the
course. However, there are also some other functions within Moodle that enable the
Gradebook to be further enhanced or to track progress outside it. In this chapter we
will do the following:

- Set pass grades to visually show achievement and progression for individual
  pieces of work
- Turn on activity tracking to show progress through activities on the course
- Use course completion to track progress through required elements of
  the course
- Use course and activity completion reports

### Setting pass grades

As we know, we can view the grades awarded in the Gradebook. However, we
can also set pass levels for each graded activity to provide a visual view within the
Gradebook. When pass grades are set, the Gradebook will not only show the grade
but a text color will also be applied. If the grade awarded is below the pass grade,
the text color will be red. If the grade awarded is at or above the pass grade, the
text color will be green.

*Additional Features for Progress Tracking*

This option is set from within the Gradebook and needs to be set for each
individual activity.

1. Go into the Gradebook by clicking on **Grades** in the **Administration** block.
2. Go into the **Simple view** option of the **Categories and items** section of
   the Gradebook.

```
You can also complete these tasks by turning editing on
within the grader report and clicking on the edit icon next
to the graded item.
```

1. Click on the edit icon (a cog in the **Actions** column) next to the graded item
   for which you would like to set the pass grade.
2. Click on **Show more** in the **Grade item** section.
3. You will see the **Maximum grade** option that was set when the activity was
   first created, along with the **Minimum grade** option. Beneath these two
   options there is the **Grade to pass** setting. By default the grade to pass is **0**
   but in the following example the pass grade has been set as **95.00**.
4. Click on **Save changes** at the bottom of the screen.

Once you have saved the grade to pass, return to the **Grader report** option. You will
now notice that the text color changes for any grades that have been awarded for
this assignment.

```
Chapter 8
```

On the following screenshot, the grade for **Task 1** for **Madeline W** is shown in green
which indicates that it is at or above the required pass grade. However, the grade for
**Bayley W** is below the pass grade so the grade is shown in red.

Adding pass grades, where relevant, can help the teacher to quickly see how learners
are progressing while viewing the Gradebook. Setting pass grades can also be useful
in other areas of Moodle to show a quick summary of whether students have passed
or not. For example, setting a pass grade can show whether a task is complete or not
when using the activity completion functions.

### Activity completion

Activity completion in Moodle allows students and teachers to track the use of
resources and activities. This information can be shown to students on the Moodle
screen and in a report for teachers. It can also be used as one of the criteria for
determining course completion status.

Activity completion can be set for any resource or activity within a course. Each
item within the course needs to be set to enable activity completion, so we are able
to choose for some items to be tracked while others are not. For the purpose of this
chapter, we're only going to set assignments to be tracked, but the instructions are
the same for all resources and activities.

In order for activity completion to be used, it needs to be turned on in site
administration and course administration.

```
Site administrators can find the option by navigating to Site
administration | Advanced features and they need to tick
the Enable completion tracking box.
```

*Additional Features for Progress Tracking*

Once **Completion tracking** is turned on for the Moodle site, teachers can turn on
the option within the course by going into the **Administration** block and clicking
on **Edit settings** under the **Course administration** heading. Once in this screen, we
need to scroll down and click on the **Completion tracking** title. Under the **Enable
completion tracking** field, change the option to **Yes** to turn on this option:

Click on **Save changes** at the bottom of the screen. We can now add activity tracking
to any resource or activity within the course. We have already set the option for
a pass grade on an assignment, so we will now also add activity completion to it
to see how this enables us to check progress.

1. View the assignment on the screen and click on **Edit settings** in the
   **Administration** block.
2. Scroll down and click on the **Activity completion** text toward the bottom
   of the page:

```
Chapter 8
```

1. The **Completion tracking** drop-down list will have three options:
   ° **Do not indicate activity completion** : The resource will appear on
   the Moodle course without any activity completion options.
   ° **Students can manually mark as complete** : Students will tick the
   activity to show that they have viewed or completed it. This is often
   a good choice for Moodle resources where you want to track whether
   the student has read the content. For example, the student ticks the
   activity to say they have read it as Moodle can only tell if a student
   has clicked on the link.
   ° **Show activity as complete when conditions are met** : Moodle will
   indicate whether the resource or activity has been completed or not.
   Depending on the type of activity, the options for completion vary.
   This is often the best option to choose for Moodle activities where
   specific tasks need to be completed.
2. Choose **Show activity as complete when conditions are met**.
3. The options below the drop-down list are the different ways in which
   Moodle can decide whether the activity has been completed or not and will
   vary depending on the type of activity. All resources and activities will have
   the **Student must view this activity to complete it** option. However, since an
   assignment is a graded activity, we also get the **Student must receive a grade**
   **to complete this activity** option. Put in a tick in the box to choose this option.
4. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on **Save and return to course**.

Take a look at the course screen and you will now notice a tick box icon on the
right-hand side of the assignment:

The box indicates that the resource has activity completion settings associated with
it, and a tick will appear in the box when the activity is complete. This icon is viewed
by individual students to show their progress through the course.

```
The tick box shown in the previous screenshot has a dotted outline.
This indicates that Moodle will be adding the tick when the activity
is complete. For activities where the student will mark the activity
as complete, this box is shown with a solid line. Students will add a
tick on the box to state that the activity has been completed. A good
tip is to add instructions into the description box when setting up the
activity to tell the students that they will need to click inside the box
to mark the activity as complete.
```

*Additional Features for Progress Tracking*

By default, as soon as the assignment is graded, the activity will be marked as
complete. However, as we have set a grade to pass, the activity will be marked as
complete only when the assignment is graded at or above the required pass grade.

#### Reporting

Let's take a look at how students and teachers view the activity completion
information.

##### The student view

Students view their progress through the main course screen. Next to each item that
has activity completion set up, the student will see a tick once that item has been
completed. In the case of assignments with a pass grade, the student will see a tick
when the assignment has been graded at the pass grade or higher. If the student
does not gain the minimum grade to pass, a cross will appear next to the resource.

The following screenshot shows **Task 1** on the main course screen when **Madeline
W** is logged in:

A green tick is shown next to **Task 1** , which means Madeline has completed this task
and has achieved at least the minimum pass grade. We can also see that **Task 2** is
complete. This is shown with a blue tick and a solid outline on the check box as this
has been marked as complete by the student. **Task 3** , **Task 4** , and **Task 5** are not yet
complete as they do not have any ticks next to them. This means that either Madeline
has not completed the work or the work has not yet been graded.

In the following screenshot, we can see that the course screen of **Bayley W** shows
**Task 1** with a red cross next to it to indicate that the assignment has been graded
but it has not yet met the required pass grade. This shows that the activity is not
yet complete.

The individual course screen and completion status of each activity will vary for
each student. However, the teacher will want to see all of the completion information
on one screen.

##### The teacher view

A teacher can view the students' progress through the **Activity completion** report
which will show the activity completion status for each student of the course for each
activity that has activity completion turned on. To get to this report, we need to use
the **Administration** block and find the **Reports** link:

*Additional Features for Progress Tracking*

The report we need to use is **Activity completion**. After clicking on this option, we
will see a screen similar to the following:

There are many resources within the course but this report will show only those
resources and activities where activity completion has been set. We can see each
student on the course listed on the left-hand side, and the activities that have activity
completion settings added to them will appear across the top of the screen. This table
will show the current completion status for each student and for each activity.

In the previous screenshot, we can see that one student has currently passed **Task
1** and one student has not yet passed. If the assignment had not yet been submitted
for any student or it hadn't been graded, there would be no color icon in the activity
column as shown for **Bayley W** for **Task 2**. Cross icons appear only when grades to
pass have been set and the student has not achieved the required grade.

This activity report enables the teacher to very quickly see progress on required
items in the course. When used with the **Grade to pass** option, the teacher can very
easily view how individual students are progressing in a simple format. It does not,
however, provide the specific grade for each assignment, so it does not completely
replace the Gradebook. We can click on the activity name in the top row and this
will take us to the activity (and give access to the grades) if required. However, in
courses where students only need to complete and pass specific activities, the activity
completion report could be used instead of the Gradebook for progress tracking.

You will notice that it is possible to choose letters for **First name** and **Surname** to
filter the group to see specific students. If you have set up groups in the course as
explained in *Chapter 7* , *Reporting with the Gradebook* , the list of groups will also appear
in this activity completion report to filter groups of students. You can also download
this data in a spreadsheet for further use and manipulation.

```
Chapter 8
```

If courses have lots of resources with activity completion added, this report can be
quite big. However, it is possible to further select activities for reporting through the
use of course completion.

### Course completion

Course completion enables the teacher to set the required elements that must be
completed in order to achieve the course. This can be used in the same way as
activity completion, and it can also be used to complement it.

For example, an online course can contain a wide range of resources and activities
that could be a mixture of required elements alongside further supplementary
resources. However, some of these activities, such as the assessed elements, might
need to be tracked separately by the teacher and looking through the whole activity
report could be quite time consuming. This is where course completion can be used.

Within the course, where course completion is to be added, click on the
**Administration** block and click on **Course Completion** :

```
This needs to be enabled within the course first as explained in
the Activity tracking section of this chapter.
```

*Additional Features for Progress Tracking*

We have a number of options within the **Completion completion** screen. We can
enable one or many options and choose whether all of these options are required
or the course will be complete if any one of them has been achieved. These options
are as follows:

- **General** : This is where we can choose whether all the options that we set are
  required or if any of them can be completed (in which case, as long as one of
  them is completed, the student will complete the course).
- **Condition: Activity completion** : All resources and activities that have
  activity completion added to them will appear in a list here with a checkbox
  next to them. It is here that we will choose the required elements that need to
  be achieved in order to complete the course. For our example, there is a list
  of all the assignments within the course. Put a tick next to each assignment
  in your course. At the bottom of the list, there is also an option for you to
  choose whether students need to complete all or any of these activities.
  You can see these options in the following screenshot:
- **Condition: Completion of other courses** : If other courses on the site
  have course completion set up, we can choose other courses that need to be
  completed before this course can be marked as complete. Students can work
  on the online courses concurrently but the course where this setting is enabled
  will not be marked as complete until the chosen prerequisite courses are also
  marked as complete. We also get an "any or all" option again.

- **Condition: Date** : If this option is enabled students will not be able to
  complete the course until at least the date set.
- **Condition: Enrolment duration** : This is similar to the date option but instead
  of specifying a date, we can choose a length of time that the student needs to
  be enrolled on the course. If enabled, students will not be able to complete
  the course until at least the specified number of days from which they
  became members of the online course.
- **Condition: Unenrolment** : This will mark the course as complete when a
  student is unenrolled from the course.
- **Condition: Course Grade** : If enabled, a course pass grade can be set. Once
  the Gradebook course total meets this grade for a student, this element will
  be marked as complete on the course completion report.
- **Manual self completion** : If this option is enabled, students will be able
  to indicate that they have completed the course. If we use this option, the
  self-completion block must also be added to the course to give students
  the option to choose **Complete course**.
- **Manual completion by** : This can be used as a final checking procedure. If a
  role is chosen here, any user with that role will need to check all the activities
  and manually confirm that the work is completed. This is very useful where
  additional paperwork or checking is required. We also get an "any or all"
  option here to choose whether multiple roles need to sign off the completion
  or only one is required. For our example, choose **Teacher**.
- Click on **Save changes**.

#### Reporting

It is possible to access the course completion report through the **Reports** option
within the **Administration** menu in the same way as the activity completion
report. However, there is also a block available to further enhance the use of
course completion.

To add the block, do the following steps:

1. Click on **Turn editing on**.
2. Find the **Add a block** option (usually at the bottom of all the existing blocks
   on the left-hand side of the course) and click on **Add**.
3. Choose **Course completion status**.

*Additional Features for Progress Tracking*

##### The teacher view

The block will look like this to the teacher:

Click on **View course report**. You will see a report similar to the activity completion
report but it will only show the options, resources, and activities that were chosen in
the course completion setup process:

The report shows ticks for **Activities** that have been completed successfully or
crosses where a student has not yet met the specific requirements for the activity and
has not been awarded the required pass grade (when a **Grade to pass** has been set).
There will be no icon shown for the activities that are not yet complete. Note that
under the **Activities** title it says **All** indicating that all the activities are required.

```
Chapter 8
```

Under the **Approval** heading, there is a **Teacher** column. This is used by the teacher
to manually tick when they are satisfied that all the required elements have been
completed. If no role is set up for manual completion, this column will not be in the
course report. If multiple roles had been set up, they would all appear here. Notice
again that it shows the **All the approval roles are required** message. In this case,
only one is required.

If self-completion has been turned on, this will also be shown here.

Finally, the **Course** heading has a **Course complete** column. When all the required
elements have a tick within them, a tick will automatically appear in this column.

If any course prerequisites or course grades have been set in the Completion completion screen, these elements will be shown in the report.



As with the activity completion report, you can view specific students, download the report, and use groups on this screen. 

##### The student view

A student will see a different version of this report and, of course, it will only show
them their own data. Let's take a look at what Madeline W would see.

On the main screen of the course, Madeline sees a summary of her progress to date
in the **Course completion** status block:

*Additional Features for Progress Tracking*

Madeline can see that the course is currently in progress and that two out of the five
required activities are complete. Madeline can get further information by clicking on
**More details**. This will show the following window:

This provides further information about the activities that need to be completed and
the current status of each item required. If the activities are complete, the completion
date is shown.

If self-completion is enabled for the course, students will also see a **Self completion**
option within this report. When using this option, the **Self completion** block must
also be added to the course. This block contains a link that says **Complete course**.
This is clicked when the student is ready to complete the course (that is, when they
feel that everything is finished and complete):

After clicking on the **Complete course** text, the student will be asked to confirm by
clicking on **Yes** or **No** :

Please note that students can click on this even if the required course activities are
not yet complete.

The activity and course completion reports are updated when the cron job is completed on the server. This captures the most up-to-date information in relation to Moodle activities to ensure the reports are up to date. If the reports need to be constantly up to date, the cron job might need to be set up to run regularly. Speak with your Moodle administrator to find out more about the cron job.

### Summary

The **Moodle Gradebook** may be as complex as student evaluation can be. They can also be used to show view of the elements that the student has achieved to date. Some characteristics we have discussed in this trainingmaterial have been:

- Election of resources and activities that are able to be reported on the Gradebook.
- Monitoring of activities completion.
- A deep look to the Gradebook key features.
- The default settings.
- _Gradebook Settings_ customization both, at course or teacher levels and those depending on the site administrator.
- 

Through the use of numerical grades, letter grades, and scales, a teacher can customize
their Gradebook to ensure that it can meet the specific course requirements. Where
required, a teacher can also make use of outcomes that can be used in conjunction with
a scale to demonstrate competency against specific criteria. Each type of grade has its
own benefits, but the options you would like to calculate the final grade should be
considered before you choose your grade type in order to ensure that it meets your
needs. Remember that numerical grades or grade letters can always be calculated in
a more straightforward manner than word grades (scales). Scales should only be used
when no grading or only simple grading is required. However, numerical grades and
letter grades can be used for more complex grading requirements.

We will now take a look at how to add these grading options to assignments within
Moodle before you learn how to grade work.

### Summary 3

In this chapter, we added a range of assignments that made use of number and scale
grades as well as added outcomes to an assignment. We also added two assignments
using the advanced grading methods that will enable us to grade assignments using
specific criteria. Finally, we added a graded item directly into the Gradebook.

In the next chapter, we will look at grading assessments. We will add number and scale
grades, add written feedback, grade outcomes, and make use of the marking guides
and rubrics we created. We will also review the options within the marking workflow,
use the offline grading worksheet, and grade work directly within the Gradebook.

# Gradebook Glossary of Terms

Here are some terms used in the gradebook, both in the development and the user interface. Using these terms in discussions about the gradebook will help to reduce confusion.



| Term                                                         | Definition                                                   |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Activity                                                     | An instance of an activity module (e.g. a single quiz, assignment etc...) |
| Calculation                                                  | A formula used to calculate grades, based (optionally) on other grade items. Not the same as [Calculated question types](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Calculated_question_type). |
| Category                                                     | A set of Grade Items. A Category also has its own aggregated Grade which is calculated from its Grade Items. There is no limit to the level of nesting of Categories (a Category may belong to another Category). However, each Grade Item may belong to only one Category. |
| Course completion                                            | The concept of meeting certain criteria for completing a course. In the context of the gradebook, this means a set of grades that must be reached, or a number of outcomes/competencies to complete/master. |
| Grade                                                        | A Grade is a single assessment. It may be a number or an item on a scale (possibly tied to an Outcome). Raw grade value is the numerical or scale grade from activity. Final grade is the grade reported in gradebook. |
| [Gradebook](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/index.php?title=Gradebook&action=edit&redlink=1) | A central location in Moodle where students' Grades are stored and displayed. Teachers can keep track of their students' progress and organise which set of Grades their students will be able to see. Students see their own Grades. |
| Grade Item                                                   | A "column" of Grades. It can be created from a specific Activity or other module, calculated from other Grade Items, or entered manually. |
| [Grade Locks](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Grades#Locked_grades) | Both whole columns and individual grades can be locked in the gradebook, via the *locked* field. |
| History                                                      | The gradebook has its own type of log, which keeps a History of all changes made to grades. |
| [Outcome](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Outcomes)              | [Outcomes](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Outcomes) are specific descriptions of what a person is expected to be able to do or understand at the completion of an activity or course. An activity might have more than one outcome, and each may have a grade against it (usually on a scale). Other terms for Outcomes are *Competencies* and *Goals*. See some [Examples](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Outcomes_examples). |
| [Scale](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Scales)                  | A scale is a set of responses from which the teacher can choose one. eg Very cool, Cool, Fairly cool, Not very cool, Not cool |
| Letter Grades                                                | Special representation of grade values similar to scales. Letters are configured in course contexts or above and are defined by lower boundary. eg A (above 90 %), B (above 80 %), C (above 70 %), D (above 50 %), F (above 0 %) |





[^1]: Scale is an option to grade assignments or rate forum posts with words instead of numbers. Visit [moodle docs](https://docs.moodle.org/310/en/Main_page) for more information.
[^2]: Numeric grades are the simplest type of grading used to calculate course scores. Numbers are always easier to add than words!

[^3]: If you would like to use a scale that is available site-wide an administrator also has the option to set this as a standard scale by checking the box. Teachers will not be able to choose this option.
[^4]: Further information about evaluation by competences (in Spanish) at [this link](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modelo_curricular_basado_en_competencias).
[^5]: If scale is chosen, you can select scale from the drop down menu. If Point, select in the mbox below the points assigned to the grading as it was set by the site administrator.
[^6]: If simple grading or advanced grading (like rubrics, learning analytics or advenced learning analytics). Visit [moodle docs](https://docs.moodle.org/310/en/Main_page) for more information. 
[^7]: if you or your administrators have set grade categories (for example problem collection, web search, etc.) you can choose one of then. By default moodle show Uncategorized option.
[^8]: Determines the minimum grade to pass: In green we'll see passed. In red not passed.
[^9]: This is a proposal for an additional feature to allow marks to be reviewed and approved before release to students.

[^10]: If no rubric form is created at this stage, the simple direct grading method will be used; this means that the teacher will manually add in the final grade rather than grade the assignment using the criteria.
