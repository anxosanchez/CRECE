# Assigning Grades

Once graded activities are added to a Moodle course, we need to award grades to students. Some of the activities are graded by Moodle, such as quizzes and some elements of lessons, but activities with a lot of written content need to be reviewed and graded by the teacher.

In this chapter, we will look at different ways of grading work using a range of
grade types. We will see how to:

- Grade assignments with number grades, scales, outcomes, marking guides,
  and rubrics
- Add written feedback, including inline comments with online text submitted
  by students
- Download and upload grades using the offline grading options
- Use quick grading directly within the Gradebook

*Assigning Grades*

### Grading an assignment

Let's first find our way to assignments and the grading screen. Within a course,
we need to click on the name of the assignment that we want to grade. If you created
the assignments based on the instructions within *Chapter 3* , *Adding Graded Activities* ,
click on **Task 1** to view it.

At the top of the assignment screen, we can see the name of the assignment—in
this case, **Task 1** —as well as the assignment details. Beneath the assignment details,
we are provided with a **Grading summary** section. The grading summary tells us
about the following options:

- How many students under the **Participants** option are in the course for
  which we are expecting assignments to be submitted.
- Beneath this, we can see whether any drafts of work have been submitted
  in the **Drafts** section.
- The **Submitted** option tells us how many students have submitted their
  assignment. This is only relevant when students are required to submit
  their work electronically either through file or an online submission.
- The **Needs grading** option tells us how many of the submitted pieces
  of assignments need to be graded. This is particularly useful for teachers
  so that they can quickly see whether they are required to grade any
  assignment without checking each student submission individually.

Underneath the grading summary, there is the **View/grade all submissions** text.
This is a hyperlink that will take us to the assignment grading screen. Click on this
link to go into the assignment grading area.

```
Chapter 4
```

You can see how the grading screen will look in the following screenshot:

There are three main sections on this page:

- The **Grading action** option is shown at the top of the page. This is a
  drop-down list through which you can choose to download assignments
  or select alternative ways of grading.
- The main grading table provides information related to the assessments of
  each student.
- At the bottom of the assignment grading screen is the **Options** section that
  enables us to change how we view the assignment grading screen.

There are a lot of options as well as a lot of information on this screen, so we will
look at one section at a time. The first area we are going to use is in the central table,
as this contains the core information about the assessments for each student. The
table starts with the name of each student on the left-hand side, and each column
provides different details of student submissions and grades. Each column is
explained in the upcoming section.

```
Under the title of each column, there is a – symbol that enables a
user to hide the content of the column. This is useful in order to
provide more usable space. After a column has been collapsed,
we will see a + symbol and enable it to expand it again.
```

*Assigning Grades*

In the following screenshot, the **User picture** and **Email address** columns have been
minimized in order to show more information:

These columns are explained as follows:

- The first column is a **Select** column where we can choose to select student
  rows in order to apply actions to them. The options for the selected rows
  appear beneath the grading table in a drop-down list, as shown in the
  following screenshot:
- There are five options to choose from within the list. All the actions within
  this list can also be undertaken when grading individual assignments, but
  using the **Select** column and choosing an option from the list allows the
  action to be applied to multiple students at the same time. After selecting
  an option, we will click on the **Go** button to complete the action. The five
  options are explained as follows:
  ° **Lock submissions** : This allows a teacher to lock the assignment
  submissions of selected students in order to prevent them from
  amending or changing their work while the grading process is
  taking place.

Unlock submissions : This allows a teacher to unlock assignments
in order to enable students to amend or re-upload their work.
° Revert the submission back to draft status : This option allows
students to resubmit their work.
° Send feedback files : This option is only available when file
submissions are enabled. The option here allows a teacher to upload
feedback files for students. We will be looking at this when grading
individual assignments, but this option can be used for a quick
upload of feedback files for multiple students.
° Set marking workflow state : This option is only relevant when the
marking workflow has been turned on when creating the assignment.
This enables the teacher to amend the current workflow status of the
assignment for multiple students at the same time.

- The next column is the **User picture** column, which is shown in the
  screenshot as a **+** symbol as this has been minimized. This column,
  as suggested, shows you the image a student has uploaded as their
  profile picture. If blind marking has been turned on for the assignment,
  no column for the user's picture will be shown.
- The **First name/surname** column shows you the student's name at the
  beginning of each row. If blind marking is turned on for an assignment,
  a participant number will be shown here instead.
- The **Email address** column shows you the student's email address. In the
  screenshot, this is shown with a **+** symbol, as this has been minimized.
- The **Status** column shows you the submission and grading status of the
  assignment of the student. It will indicate whether a student has submitted
  their assignment (either **No submission** or **Submitted for grading** ). It will
  also show you the grading status ( **Not marked** or **Graded** ).
- The **Grade** column shows you an icon that is used to access the grading
  page for a specific student. After the work has been graded, the currently
  awarded grade will be shown in this column.
- The **Edit** column also enables us to access the assignment grading page
  as well as perform some quick actions for the assignment. The options will
  vary depending on the options chosen when creating the assignment and
  the current status of the assignment. However, the options we are most
  likely to see are:
  ° The **Grade** or **Update grade** option: This takes us to the assignment
  grading page.

*Assigning Grades*

The Prevent submission changes option: This enables us to lock a
student's submission so that it can no longer be changed.
° The Grant extension option: This allows the student to submit their
assignment after the due date but before the cut-off date. This option
is only available if a cut-off date was added when the assignment
was created.
° The Edit submission option: This allows the teacher to upload a file
or add online text on behalf of a student. This option is only shown
prior to students submitting their own assignment.
° The Revert submission to draft option: This is shown if students
have submitted their assignment but it hasn't been graded yet.
Choosing this option will allow the student to submit their
assignment again.
° The Allow another attempt option: This enables the student to have
another go at submitting their work. It will enable regrading by the
teacher following the submission.

- The next column on the assignment grading table is the **Last modified**
  **(submission)** column. This will show you the date and time when the
  student submitted their work for grading.
- **File submissions** and/or **Online text** will show a link to the file/files that
  students have uploaded for grading or written into the online text area for
  submission. Teachers can click to view the files from here, or can view them
  from the individual grading screen. For assignments with both online and
  file submissions enabled, there will be two columns.
- **Submission comments** will allow the teacher to view any comments added
  by students while they were submitting their assignment if this option was
  turned on within the assignment.
- The **Last modified (grade)** column will show you the date and time when
  the assignment was graded by a teacher.
- **Feedback comments** will show you the start of any comments given by the
  teacher after the assignment has been graded.
- If an assignment is submitted as a .pdf file, the teacher is given an option
  to grade it using an integrated editor that allows the teacher to review and
  annotate the work directly within Moodle. If this option is used for grading,
  a **View annotated PDF** button will appear within the **Annotate PDF** column.
- **Feedback files** will show you a hyperlink to any files uploaded by the
  teacher to provide feedback to students. This will only be shown if the
  **Feedback files** option was selected when creating the assignment.

```
Chapter 4
```

- The **Final grade** column shows you the grade that was awarded to the student.
- When **Outcomes** are added to an assignment, a column will show you which
  outcomes are being met by the assignment. Following the grading, this
  column will show you the grade for each of the outcomes.

There is a lot of information in this table and it provides a good overview of the
current status of the assignment for each student.

Some grading can take place from this screen, which we will look at in more detail
later, but we will now go to an individual student's grading screen. Click on the
**Grade** icon in the **Status** column next to the student you want to grade (make sure
that you choose a student who has submitted some work). There are three main
sections on the individual grading screen. We will look at each one in turn.

#### The Submission Status section

The **Submission status** section provides a summary of the assignment for this
student, including which attempt this piece of work is, the current submission and
grading status of the piece of work, the date the work was submitted, and access to
any submitted work. The submitted work can be in the form of a hyperlink to a file
or the content of the online submission. For the **Task 1** assignment, students were
required to submit a file for their work, and we can see from the following screenshot
that **Bayley W** has submitted his assignment:

When files are uploaded, the teacher can click on them in order to open them to view
the content.

*Assigning Grades*

#### The Grades section

The **Grade** section will enable us to assign a grade and provide feedback to students,
as shown in the following screenshot:

The first option is to select the grade for the piece of work. The grade will depend on
the type of grade we selected when creating the assignment. For **Task 1** , we selected
**scale grade** , so we are provided with a drop-down list from which we can choose
our grade. When grading this assignment for the first time, the **Grade** drop-down list
will say **No grade**. If this work is being regraded, then the currently assigned grade
will be shown in this list.

The next option within the **Grade** section is **Marking workflow state**. This will only
appear if the marking workflow is turned on when initially setting up the assignment.

There are six options that the teacher can choose when they are grading the work:

- **Not marked** : This is the state that will be shown prior to grading.
- **In marking** : This will be chosen if the teacher has started grading the
  assignment but hasn't completed it yet. This option will show other
  teachers that the grading is still in progress. Students won't be able
  to view their grade when this option is chosen.
- **Marking completed** : This option will be chosen when the grading is
  complete, but it should be kept hidden from students. It can be used
  if a teacher has marked this piece of work but is still grading the work
  of others.
- **In review** : This option will be used if the initial teacher or assessor has
  graded the assignment but it needs to undergo a second grading process
  or needs to be moderated inline along with other work.
- **Ready for release** : This option will be chosen if the work has been graded
  and reviewed, where appropriate, and is ready for students to view, but
  we still want to prevent the student from seeing it. This can be used when
  teachers want to release the assignment to all students at the same time but
  they are still in the process of grading other work.
- **Released** : This releases the grades and feedback to students and the grade
  appears within their Gradebook.

The final options within the **Grade** section provide feedback. There were two
options that were selected when we created this assignment: **Feedback comments**
and **Feedback files**. Within the **Feedback comments** section, we can write feedback
for students based on their work. This section has a text editor so that text can be
formatted. Within the **Feedback files** section, we can upload files through the **+** icon
or drag-and-drop them in order to give more information to students. This could be
an annotated copy of the student's original uploaded work, a completed feedback
form, or even a sound file that provides audio feedback.

*Assigning Grades*

#### Attempt settings

The final section of the assignment grading screen outlines the current status and
some further options for the assignment. The details within this section will vary
depending on how the initial assignment was set up. In this example, we opted for
attempts to be reopened automatically, so we are only provided with the details of
this rather than the option that can change it.

Once each of these sections has been completed, we need to save our work. There are
five options at the bottom of the individual grading screen:

- **Save changes** : This enables you to save the grade and feedback and go back
  to the assignment grading table.
- **Save and show next** : This will save the grade and feedback and move onto
  the next individual grading page in order to grade another assignment.

- **Cancel** : This will cancel any work completed on the current individual
  grading screen and show you the assignment grading area.
- **Previous** : This will go to the assignment grading screen of the previous
  student in the grading list but will not save any work completed on the
  current grading screen.
- **Next** : This will move on to the next individual grading page but will not
  save any work completed on the current grading screen.

Once the grading has been completed, you will see that the assignment grading table
has been updated. Take a look at **Bayley W** in the following screenshot:

All the information regarding the work of **Bayley W** is explained as follows:

- The **Status** column shows you the text, **Submitted for grading** and
  **Released** which means that not only the work is submitted but has
  also been released after grading.
- A grade is now shown in the **Grade** column as well as in the **Final**
  **grade** column.
- The **Last modified (grade)** column shows you the date and time when
  the grade was last updated.
- You can see the beginning of the written feedback provided in the
  **Feedback comments** column. A magnifying glass icon shown in this
  column enables users to view all the feedback.

When creating the assignment, we enabled offline grading, so let's take a look
at how we access this and some of the other grading options available from the
grading table page.

*Assigning Grades*

#### Grading options

At the top of the assignment grading table page, there is a drop-down list that
provides you with a range of grading options. There are up to five options available
in this list but the options will depend on which options were turned on when the
assignment was created.

These options are explained as follows:

- **Download all submissions** : This enables a teacher to download all the
  files uploaded to this assignment. This will create a .zip file that can be
  used to view all the work when offline.
- **Download grading worksheet** : This option is only available if offline
  grading has been enabled when creating the assignment. It downloads
  a .csv file that contains the assignment information.

- **Upload grading worksheet** : We will choose this option if we want to upload
  the amended grading worksheet.
- **Upload multiple feedback files in a zip** : This option allows students' work
  to be annotated and re-uploaded as feedback. This works with the **Download**
  **all submissions** option. After downloading the files, the folder needs to be
  unzipped and all files need to be moved to a new folder. The teacher can then
  review and edit or annotate the files and save them. The file names must not
  be changed. The new folder can then be zipped and uploaded through this
  option. This will assign the relevant feedback files to the relevant students.
- **View gradebook** : This option will take us straight to the Gradebook area in
  order to view all grades for all students.

*Assigning Grades*

#### Options

The **Options** section enables us to customize how the grading table is viewed as well
as provide some quick grading options. Individual teachers can customize how they
view the assignment grading area. Three main options are shown at the bottom of
the assignment grading screen.

These options are explained as follows:

- **Assignments per page** : This option allows us to choose how many rows
  of students are shown per page. For example, if we have 12 students in
  the course, we can choose to view all 12 on one screen rather than move
  to another screen to review the final two students. Alternatively, if students
  are submitting many files per assignment, we might only want to view
  one or two students per page so that we can see all the information easily
  on the screen.
- **Filter** : This is a very useful drop-down list on the grading table that only
  shows you the assignments that we need to consider:
  ° **Not submitted** : This only shows you students who have not
  submitted any work
  ° **Submitted** : This only shows you students who have submitted
  an assignment
  ° **Requires grading** : This option will only show you any assignment
  that is currently ungraded
- **Workflow filter** : This option allows a teacher to choose to view only students
  within a specific part of the workflow. This can be useful to move multiple
  students through the workflow process.

- **Quick grading** : A tick in this box will give you an alternative way to grade a
  student's work. Let's look at this in more detail.

#### Quick grading within the assignment grading screen

Turning on the **Quick grading** option turns the assignment grading area into an
editable table that will enable us to add a grade and some written feedback directly
onto the screen without needing to enter individual student pages. Quick grading
is very useful for offline activities or assignments that have already been viewed
offline. When a tick is added to the **Quick grading** box, three columns are changed.

- The **Status** column includes a drop-down list that changes the workflow phase
  for the student (if the marking workflow is turned on for the assignment).
- The **Grade** column also has a drop-down list next to each student in order to
  enable us to choose the grade that we would like to award. This is the same
  drop-down list as the one on the individual grading screen and will show
  you all the options within the scale. If this assignment were to be graded
  with a number, an empty text box would appear here in order to enable
  us to type in the grade to be awarded.
- The **Feedback comments** column also has a text entry box that enables us
  to type in some feedback for the assignment. The feedback box can be made
  larger with the resizing area in the bottom-right section of the box, but there
  is no editor to change how the information looks.

*Assigning Grades*

Once all the grades and written feedback have been added, it is important that you
click on **Save all quick grading changes** at the bottom of the grading table in order
to save the completed feedback. We have now seen most of the main features and
functions of the assignment grading table. However, we created a range of different
type of assignments, so let's take a look at how we can grade other grade types.

#### Grading an online text assignment with a number grade

When creating assignments in *Chapter 3* , *Adding Graded Activities* , we created **Task 2**
in order to enable students to submit text online, and the maximum grade possible
was set to **20**. View Task 2 to follow the instructions for the grading process.

As with the previous assignment, we are initially provided with **Grading summary** ,
and we need to click on **View/grade all assignments**. This will open up the assignment
grading table.

```
Chapter 4
```

The grading table is similar to the one we have already used, but on this table, we
have an **Online text** column instead of a **File submissions** column. Take a look at
your grading table and choose a student who has the **Submitted for grading** text
in the **Status** column. Click on the **grading** icon within the **Grade** column next to
the student's name.

As shown previously, the page begins with some information about the **Submission
status** section. Much of this information is the same as what was used previously,
but take note of the **Online text** information shown on this page. This will allow you
to read the assignment submitted by the student. In most cases, there will be more
text than can be seen on this screen, so a **+** symbol is shown for us to expand the
information in order to read the full submission.

*Assigning Grades*

In the **Submission status** section, we have the **Grade** section, which begins with the
option to assign a grade. For the previous assignment, we graded assignments with
a scale that provided a drop-down list for us to choose the grade. As this assignment
is a number grade, we are provided with a text entry box instead and are informed
to assign a grade in the **Grade out of 20** option. We are not likely to complete this
until we have reviewed the work but when we are ready, we simply need to type
in a number between 0 and 20 in order to assign a grade to the assignment.

Toward the bottom of this section, we can see that the **Feedback comments** box
already has some text in it. This text is the assignment submitted by the student.
This information appears in the box, as we selected **Comment inline** when we
initially created the assignment. We can edit this text and add further information
in order to provide feedback to the students. We will need to make our feedback
stand out from the student's original text, so we will need to make use of the text
editor that is available at the top of the **Feedback comments** box.

```
Chapter 4
```

Click on **Save changes** to submit the feedback and grade to the Gradebook and
inform the student.

So far, we have graded assignments with a scale and number and have viewed
assignments submitted as a file and online text. When creating assignments, we
also set up a third task, which is **Task 3** , that makes use of all of these and utilizes
the **Outcomes** feature. Let's take a look now at how to grade outcomes.

#### Grading an assignment with outcomes

After viewing the assignment and clicking on **View/grade all assignments** , we will
see the assignment grading table. As this assignment has enabled **File submissions**
and **Online text** submissions, both of these columns appear in the table. As we have
added outcomes to this assignment, there is an additional column at the end of the
grading table, which shows you the outcomes that are used.

Note that currently, the text **No outcome** appears with each outcome. This shows
you that the assignments haven't been graded yet.

*Assigning Grades*

We will use the individual grading screen to grade the outcomes, so we need to
click on the **grade** icon in the **Grade** column next to the student whose work we
want to mark.

Once we're on the individual grading screen, the **Submission status** area enables us
to access the file and online text submitted by the student. The **Grade** section is very
similar to the one used previously. A final grade will be awarded and we can enter a
numerical value in the **Grade out of 100** option in the **Grade** box.

However, there are additional items to grade now: **Evidence provided** and **Criteria 1
met**. Next to the name of each outcome is a drop-down list that provides us with the
scale chosen when setting up the outcomes. To grade each outcome, we need to click
on the drop-down list in order to choose the grade we want to provide.

```
Chapter 4
```

The other option we turned on for this assignment, which we haven't seen in practice
yet, is the option to manually reopen an assignment in order to enable resubmission.
This option is within the **Attempt settings** section.

If we want to enable the student to resubmit their work again, we need to change
the **Allow another attempt** option to **Yes** using the drop-down list.

When grading all assignments, we need to ensure that we click on **Save changes**
when we have added the grades and feedback.

We have now looked at all the key options when grading assignments with the
simple direct grading method, and we have also created assignments using the
advanced grading methods that utilize the marking guide and rubric grading
tools. Let's take a look at how to grade these assignments.

### Grading an assignment with a marking guide

If you followed the instructions in *Chapter 3* , *Adding Graded Activities* , open the
assignment titled **Assignment 4**.

The assignment grading table will be the same as the one we have seen previously
with the simple grading method, Click on **View/grade all submissions** and click
on the grade icon next to a student that you want to grade.

*Assigning Grades*

The biggest difference between the grading pages we have seen previously and
using the marking guide is the way in which we grade the assignment. When grading
assignments with a scale, we were provided with a drop-down list in order to add the
grade, and for a numerical grade, we had a textbox to which we could type the grade.
For a marking guide assignment, there is no single grade entry point. Instead, we are
provided with the grading criteria for which we can add a grade. Moodle will then
add each grade together in order to provide the final grade for the assignment.

```
Chapter 4
```

Next to each piece of criteria, there is a text entry box and a score box. Take a look
at the previous screenshot and find the criteria titled **Planning**. The **Grade** section
is explained as follows:

- We can see the full details of the criteria that aids us by providing us with
  the correct grade.
- To the right of this criteria, we have a textbox where we can add feedback
  in relation to this criteria. When creating this assignment, we also added
  some comments in the **Frequently used comments** option, and we can see
  these at the bottom of the marking guide. If we would like to add any of
  these comments to the feedback, we need to click on the box where we
  want to add the comment and then click on the **+** symbol next to the
  frequently used comment that we want to use.
- The final column on the right-hand side provides a grade entry box.
  Underneath this box, we can see the maximum number of points that
  are available for this criteria. To provide a grade, we add a number
  grade up to the given maximum grade.

Like the simple grading methods, we also have the option to add general feedback, and
we can also have options to change the marking workflow and reopen submissions
depending on how the assignment was set up.

After adding the feedback and individual criteria grades, we need to click on the
**Save changes** button.

Following the grading, each score assigned to each piece of criteria is added together
in order to provide the final grade for the student, and this can be seen in the **Grade**
column in the assignment grading table.

The student will see the final grade and each individual criteria grade and feedback
when reviewing the feedback for their assignment.

The final type of grading that we set up in *Chapter 3* , *Adding Graded Activities* , was
through the use of a rubric. Grading with a rubric is similar to using a marking
guide. Let's take a look at this together.

*Assigning Grades*

### Grading an assignment with a rubric

If you created **Assignment 5** , click to view this now and make your way to the
grading screen of a selected student. Much like the marking guide, instead of
a single grade entry point, we have a table that provides us with the criteria for
the assignment. However, unlike the marking guide, we will not be grading
with a numerical grade of our choice.

The rubric table enables us to easily grade work even though there is a lot of
information on the screen.

When grading assignments, the teacher reviews the work and clicks on the box
that contains the statement and points that they want to award. We can also
add written feedback in the textbox on each row. A section to add in the overall
feedback is also available.

```
Chapter 4
```

In the following screenshot, you can see how this rubric grid has been completed by
the teacher:

The shaded boxes show you the grade awarded for each criterion, and some comments
have been added to the feedback column as well.

The final grade for the assignment is calculated by Moodle by adding together each
of the points awarded within the rubric, and this is shown in the assignment grading
table within the Grade column.

As with the marking guide, the student will see the full rubric table and comments
when they receive their assignment feedback.

*Assigning Grades*

### Grading a graded item within the Gradebook

We have seen how we can grade assignments by accessing the activities from within
the main course screen. However, in *Chapter 3* , *Adding Graded Activities* , we also added
a graded activity directly into the Gradebook. So, how do we grade this? We go into
the Gradebook! Let's take a look:

1. From the main course screen, go to the **Grades** area (navigate to
   **Administration** | **Grades** ).
2. Click on the **Turn editing on** button in the top-right corner of the screen.
3. We will be able to add a grade directly into the graded item.

In the previous screenshot, you can see the **Attendance grade** option. This item was
set up as a value grade. To add the grade, we type a number into the empty textbox.
At the bottom of the screen, there is an **Update** button that saves any grades that we
have added.

```
Chapter 4
```

We can also use this grading method for any other type of graded activity within
the Gradebook.

#### Quick grading within the Gradebook

Turning editing on within the **Grades** area will allow us to grade any graded activity.

In the previous screenshot, we can see different types of grades. **Task 1** is an example
of an assignment that is graded with a scale and, therefore, quick grading provides
a drop-down list that enables us to choose the grade we would like to award. **Task
2** and **Task 3** , however, have been set as numerical grades, so we need to type the
number into the grade box. Also, as part of **Task 3** , there are two columns that show
you outcomes that are graded using a drop-down list that chooses a scale item.

After we have amended grades on this screen, we need to click on the **Update** button
to save the grades.

There are a few things to consider when using quick grading:

- We cannot see the maximum grade when adding number grades.
- The marking guide and rubric-graded assignments cannot be marked
  via the quick grading option.

*Assigning Grades*

When using the quick grading option, we can choose to add quick feedback, but this
option is not shown on the current screen. However, we can change some settings to
enable this:

1. Click on the **My preferences** tab, or click on **Grader report** under the
   **My preferences** heading.
2. Scroll to the **General** section at the bottom of the page.
3. Next to the **Show quick feedback** text, change the drop-down list to **Yes**.
4. Click on the **Save changes** button at the bottom of the page.

The quick feedback option is limited to adding text, so if a lot of text is required,
it is recommended that the individual grading screen be used.

### Summary

In this chapter, we have seen how to grade assignments that have number or scale
grades and graded outcomes, and we used the marking guide and rubric grading
forms. We also saw how we can use the quick grading options within the assignment
area and the Gradebook screen.

We saw how we can grade individual assignments, but how do all of these come
together in the Gradebook? In the next chapter, we will look at how the grades can
work together in the Gradebook and how calculations can be set up to calculate the
final course grades. We will also see how we can further customize the Gradebook.
