## Preface

This book is the one place you'll find technical support, along with solid instructional
design. Your Moodle courses will motivate students and help them achieve success. This
book includes step-by-step guidance in creating effective courses, incorporating the content
that sets you apart, and seamlessly integrating assessment. There is a focus on collaborative
learning as well as self-guided, autonomous learning, complete with easy-to-develop
assessments and automatically generated badges and certificates. The user will learn how
to set up Moodle courses and then host and teach them at a very low cost using new cloud-
based platforms and applications. This is an introductory book designed as a quick-start
guide, which incorporates the fundamentals of sound instructional design and some of
Moodle’s latest and greatest features.

### Who this book is for

This book can be used by teachers, instructors, training managers, Moodle administrators,
instructional technologists, instructional designers, and e-learning entrepreneurs. Prior
experience with Moodle will be helpful.

### What this book covers

This is a quick-start guide to Moodle, a leading virtual learning environment for your
online course. This guide incorporates principles of instructional design to show you how
to develop and deploy courses, content, and assessment. We cover MoodleCloud and
provide guidance using the latest default theme, Boost. There is a special emphasis on
motivation, interactivity, and competency frameworks.

Chapter 1, *Preparing to Build an Exemplary Moodle Course* , brings together instructional
design and the latest version of Moodle, with an emphasis on cloud-based Moodle for the
most affordable and easily implemented solution. You will learn how to set up new courses
using the principles of instructional design and also how to build the course to motivate
students using cognitive psychology.

Chapter 2, *Planning Your Course* , allows you to build your course around learning
outcomes and shows you how to connect Bloom’s taxonomy to the design of your course
content, activities, and assessment. We also focus on accessibility and cover how to develop
a course using Universal Design for Learning.

```
Preface
```

Chapter 3, *Organizing Your Course* , guides you in building a course framework centered on
learning objectives. We use the responsive theme, Boost, which is the default theme in 3.5,
and we will also discuss cloud-based MoodleCloud to show you how you can experiment
in the cloud for free in order to truly customize your course design. We will discuss
aligning the course with learning objectives, and we will take an inventory of tools and
apps in order to match them with outcomes and student success strategies.

Chapter 4, *Best Practices in Content Delivery* , provides guidance in managing types of
content and activities using cloud-based and on-premise theme, Boost. We will learn how
to manage the different types of resources and activities and also how to use assessments to
deliver content. We will develop strategies for incorporating collaborative learning, and we
will include productivity and collaboration apps.

Chapter 5, *Designing Self-Paced Independent Study Courses* , incorporates how to set up and
launch a course with resources, activities, and assessments that can be autonomous and
self-guided. We will cover the new capabilities with MoodleCloud and apps that build in
rewards and motivation by encouraging engagement and completion.

Chapter 6, *Developing Cohort-Based Courses with Teacher-Student Interaction* , allows you to set
up a course that includes a group of students who interact with each other. You’ll be able to
select the ideal content and activities for your group of students and design the course so
that it motivates and encourages them to do their best work.

Chapter 7, *Creating Student-Centered Project-Based Courses* , demonstrates how to develop
collaborative courses for groups, and it provides examples of ideal activities and resources.
By using a project approach, you can incorporate portfolios and also take advantage of
Moodle’s flexibility by encouraging students to collaborate with videos, podcasts, graphics,
animations, presentations, and more.

Chapter 8, *Moodle for Online Communities* , emphasizes on collaboration and mission-based
activities that are often completed by groups that are working together in an organization,
professional society, or not-for-profit. There may be needs for certification or a need to
collaboratively train people on safety, processes, and procedures. We will cover
MoodleCloud and provide guidance using the latest default theme, **Boost**. There is a special
emphasis on motivation, interactivity, and competency frameworks.
