GRADEBOOK SETUP

• Gradebook can be edited to suit your

specific needs.

– Grades can be grouped into categories for

ease of use.

– Grades can also be weighted.

• All grade settings are changed in

Gradebook.





GRADEBOOK SETUP

• Once Gradebook is opened, selecting the “Setup” tab will allow

instructors to manually add grade items, create and manage

grade categories, manage category/item weights, and much

more.





CHANGING THE GRADEBOOK

AGGREGATION METHOD

• For grade calculations, myCourses uses one of three

aggregation methods.

• To change the aggregation method for your course’s gradebook,

select the “Edit” drop-down shown on the same line as your

course’s name.

Then click “Edit settings.”





CHANGING THE GRADEBOOK

AGGREGATION METHOD

• Now you’re able to manage

how the grades are calculated

for the entire course.

• The “Aggregation” option allows

you to select which grading

method you would like to use.

• Also note that there is an option

to drop the lowest grade(s).





WEIGHTED MEAN OF GRADES

• This method of aggregation is best

used with grade categories.

• With it, you can assign each

category to be worth a certain

percentage of the overall course’s

grade.

• For example:

– In my PHYS 2001 course, the

homework that students do is worth

20% of their grade.

– Exams make up the remaining 80%.





WEIGHTED MEAN OF GRADES

• As an example, let’s consider the following grade set:

**Homework Assignments (30%)**

**Exams (70%)**

ow the homework to be weighted at

30% and the exams at 70%.





WEIGHTED MEAN OF GRADES

• Moodle multiplies the category total by the weight.

– If there are no categories, Moodle will multiply the weight by the

individual grade total.

• So, for our example…

**Homework Assignments (30%)**

**Exams (70%)**

WEIGHTED MEAN OF GRADES





SIMPLE WEIGHTED MEAN OF

GRADES

• For the Simple Weighted Mean of Grades, Moodle uses the

total possible points as the weight of an assignment (or

category).

• So, let’s consider th

SIMPLE WEIGHTED MEAN OF

GRADES

• Each grade is calculated individually (if no categories are

employed).

– That ratio (score/total) is then multiplied by the total possible points.

SIMPLE WEIGHTED MEAN OF

GRADES

• Once the weights are applied to each grade, they are summed.

– That sum is divided by the sum of the weights.

NATURAL

• If you didn’t catch it in the previous slides, the simple weighted

mean of grades will return the exact same grade as the natural

aggregation.

– The student scores are added to a single total.

– The total possible points are added to a single total.

– To get the grade, simply divide the student score total by the sum of

the total possible points.
