GRADE AGGREGATION TOPICS
Weighted Mean, Simple Weighted Mean, and Natural
                        GRADEBOOK SETUP

• Gradebook can be edited to suit your specific
  needs.
   – Grades can be grouped into categories for ease of
     use.
   – Grades can also be weighted.

• All grade settings are changed in Gradebook.
                GRADEBOOK SETUP




• Once Gradebook is opened, selecting the “Setup” tab will allow
  instructors to manually add grade items, create and manage grade
  categories, manage category/item weights, and much more.
          CHANGING THE GRADEBOOK
            AGGREGATION METHOD



• For grade calculations, myCourses uses one of three aggregation
  methods.
• To change the aggregation method for your course’s gradebook, select
  the “Edit” drop-down shown on the same line as your course’s name.
   – Then click “Edit settings.”
           CHANGING THE GRADEBOOK
             AGGREGATION METHOD
• Now you’re able to manage how
  the grades are calculated for the
  entire course.
• The “Aggregation” option allows
  you to select which grading method
  you would like to use.
• Also note that there is an option to
  drop the lowest grade(s).
            WEIGHTED MEAN OF GRADES
• This method of aggregation is best
  used with grade categories.
• With it, you can assign each category
  to be worth a certain percentage of
  the overall course’s grade.
• For example:
   – In my PHYS 2001 course, the homework
     that students do is worth 20% of their
     grade.
   – Exams make up the remaining 80%.
        WEIGHTED MEAN OF GRADES
• As an example, let’s consider the following grade set:
         Homework Assignments (30%)                      Exams (70%)
              Student Score   Total Possible          Student Score   Total Possible
       HW 1        18              20          E1          88             100
       HW 2        31              35          E2          55             100
       HW 3        10              15          E3          76             100
       HW 4        5               25          TOTA       219             300
                                                 L
       TOTA        64              95
       L
• For this example, we will allow the homework to be weighted at 30%
  and the exams at 70%.
            WEIGHTED MEAN OF GRADES
• Moodle multiplies the category total by the weight.
   – If there are no categories, Moodle will multiply the weight by the individual
     grade total.

• So, for our example…
           Homework Assignments (30%)                          Exams (70%)
                 Student Score   Total Possible                Student Score   Total Possible
   Total              64              95             Total         219             300


   HW Grade                         20.21         Exam Grade                      51.10
WEIGHTED MEAN OF GRADES
 SIMPLE WEIGHTED MEAN OF GRADES
• For the Simple Weighted Mean of Grades, Moodle uses the total
  possible points as the weight of an assignment (or category).
• So, let’s consider the same set of grades.
                                 Student Grades
                               Student Score   Total Possible

 SIMPLE WEIGHTED MEAN OF GRADES
• Each grade is calculated individually (if no categories are employed).
   – That ratio (score/total) is then multiplied by the total possible points.

 SIMPLE WEIGHTED MEAN OF GRADES
• Once the weights are applied to each grade, they are summed.
     – That sum is divided by the sum of the weights.

• If you didn’t catch it in the previous slides, the simple weighted mean
  of grades will return the exact same grade as the natural
  aggregation.
   – The student scores are added to a single total.
   – The total possible points are added to a single total.
   – To get the grade, simply divide the student score total by the sum of the total
     possible points.

COURSE BEAUTIFICATION TOPICS
     Adding media to the course page.
                  EMBEDDING ITEMS
• As with any change on the main course page, improving the look of
  your course begins with the “Turn Editing On” button.
• Once the editing is enabled, you can add images, video, or other
  media to a topic by editing the settings of the topic.
                     THE TOPIC SUMMARY
                           The default name is Topic (#).
                           Removing the check allows you to name the topic whatever you want.

                                               Add media (pictures, videos, sound, etc.) here.




Add descriptive
material and media
about the topic.
                      THE TOPIC SUMMARY
• Any descriptions, directions,
  media, or anything else that is
  added to the topic summary
  will be displayed at the top of
  the topic section.
• Next, we will see how to add
  media within the topic
  materials.
    ADDING MEDIA IN OTHER PLACES
• The Topic Summary is not the only place where media can be added.
   – Labels can also be used to spruce up your course page.
   – Not only do they divide large sets of material, but they may contain media as
     well.

• To add a label into your course, click “Add an activity or resource.”
                         ADDING A LABEL
• To quote Moodle:
“Labels may be used
• To split up a long list of activities with a
  subheading or an image
• To display an embedded sound file or video
  directly on the course page
• To add a short description to a course
  section”
       ADDING MATERIAL TO A LABEL
• Notice that the interface for adding text and media to a topic
  summary is the same interface for adding material to a label.

                                              Add media (pictures, videos,
                                              sound, etc.) here.




      Add the text and
      media for the label
      to display.
MATERIAL WITHIN LABELS

      A standard label.



             A label with an image.
             The image may be displayed below the wording
             of a label.



              A label with a link.

                 LESSONS
Great ways to guide student learning within myCourses.
                                  LESSONS
• Lessons are created by the instructor of the
  course.
• They contain content and question pages.
• They may be graded or ungraded.
   – For assignments or study guides.

• The Lesson activity is a fantastic way to
  guide students toward a concept or specific
  goal.
                      CREATING A LESSON
• Creating a lesson begins at
  this page.
• Each menu below the
  Description box manages
  different aspects of the
  assignment.
• It is on this page that you
  establish the general settings
  for the entire assignment.
THE APPEARANCE DROP-DOWN
    To include a pop-up window at the beginning of a lesson,
    choose the appropriate file to display. Every lesson page
    will include a link to re-open the pop-up if necessary.




         If enabled, the lesson is displayed as a slideshow, with a fixed width
         and height.
           If enabled, when a response is not found for a particular question,
           the default response of "That's the correct answer" or "That's the
           wrong answer" will be shown.
             THE AVAILABILITY DROP-DOWN
• The Availability settings
  allow you to set times for the
  assignment to open and
  close, choose a time limit, or
  password-protect the
  assignment.
         THE FLOW-CONTROL DROP-DOWN
• The Flow-Control settings allow you to
  set how the students interact with the
  assignment.
• You may:
   – Allow students to review the assignment
     after they have completed it.
   – Allow the lesson to bring the student to a
     random, unseen page after they answer a
     question.
   – Create a pool of pages from which the
     lesson may draw (Number of pages to
     show).
                  THE GRADE DROP-DOWN
• Here, you can choose the behavior of
  the lesson’s grading.
• You may:
   – Set the type of grading system.
   – Set the maximum points.
   – Select the grade category.
   – Allow for a practice lesson (ungraded
     lesson).
   – Set point value to custom (you can assign
     point values in each question).
   – Set the minimum amount of questions for
     grading.
           CREATING THE LESSON CONTENT
• Once you have established the lesson
  settings, myCourses brings you to the
  editing page.
• Here is where you begin to build the
  lesson pages.
• You may preview the lesson as you
  progress through its creation.
• Let’s start off with a content page
  called “Directions.”
THE CONTENT PAGE




The Content menus create buttons at the bottom of the page for navigation.
                THE CONTENT PAGE
• Preview shows us how a student would see the page we just created.
              ADDING MORE PAGES
• You can add as many pages as you want under the Edit tab.
                                        A cluster is a group of question pages
                                        which will be offered randomly to a
                                        student as they work through the lesson.




• We’ll add a question page next.
                  THE QUESTION PAGE

• The Lesson activity supports
  many types of question pages.
• Let’s create a multiple-choice
  question page next.
             CREATING A MULTIPLE-CHOICE
                     QUESTION
• Creating content for the question follows the same procedures as creating a label or
  editing a topic summary.
• Note that myCourses does support multiple correct answers.
             CREATING THE CHOICES
• Each answer choice is edited in the same way as the question.
• Here, you can create your own response to student answers.




                                   The “Jump” menu dictates what happens when a
                                   student submits an answer.
                            THE LESSON SO FAR
• We have a page for directions and a question page.
• The question page contains a multiple-choice question.
    – Note the 4 “Jumps” on the question page.
    – I set each answer to progress to the next page after the student answers the question.
    – The myCourses default is for correct answers to advance to the Next page and incorrect answers to stay
      on the same page.
QUESTION PAGE PREVIEW
                 RESPONSE PREVIEW
• You may go through the lesson just as a student would.
• This allows you to preview the responses and lesson behavior as well
  as the content.
         REVIEW OF TOPICS COVERED
• Gradebook Aggregation
   – Weighted Mean, Simple Weighted Mean, and Natural allow for flexibility in
     grading student performance.
• Course Beautification
   – Adding multimedia to topic summaries or labels improves the look of the
     course.
   – If a student is more interested in what’s happening, they will learn more.
• Lessons
   – A lesson is a unique way of guiding students toward a concept or simply
     teaching a special topic.
