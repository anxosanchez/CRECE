### Cannabis’s Call to Microbrew Extracts

![img](https://extractionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/6b745b7d.jpg)

Many of us are beer fans, myself included. And no one has been more excited about the rise of the microbrewing industry than me (or maybe [Jason](https://terpenesandtesting.com/the-life-changing-doorway-at-odd-13-an-homage-to-terpenes-like-alpha-humulene/)). I’ve even attempted to brew a batch or two on my own. It wasn’t the best beer I’ve ever had, but it tasted decent, and more importantly, it was *mine*. There is a certain pride and joy that comes with making your own brews and sharing them with your family and friends. And while it may not be as easy or cheap as brewing your own beer, there may be a similar opening for a cannabis microbrewing industry to grow too.

Making solvent-based extracts at home, particularly with the use of hydrocarbon solvents, has come under scrutiny in recent years, because of the [safety hazards](https://extractionmagazine.com/category/safety-standards/hash-oil-production-butane-explosions-on-rise/) involved and the residual solvent left behind. Presented here is the Soxhlet extraction, a solvent-based extraction method that’s been tried and true for over a century for removing compounds from plant and fruit matrices, both lipid-based and water-soluble. In this case, the solvent of choice is ethanol, and the plant—why cannabis, of course.

The [Soxhlet apparatus](https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_940) was developed in the 1870’s by German chemist Franz Ritter von Soxhlet (1848–1926). He worked in the dairy industry, and originally developed the procedure (and glassware) as a means to separate cream (milk fat) from curds (solid protein formations). The apparatus was further refined with the invention of Pyrex, a borosilicate-based glass matrix, which created tougher, more resilient laboratory equipment.1 Interest fact: the “Py” in Pyrex comes from “apple pie”—the first Pyrex product! A [picture](http://ids.si.edu/ids/deliveryService?id=NMAH-ET2015-06811&max=1000) of a Pyrex Soxhlet extractor from the early 20th century, courtesy of the Smithsonian Museum of American History, is shown below.

![img](https://extractionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NMAH-ET2015-06811.jpg)While originally developed for dairy farmers, the technique von Soxhlet developed is used most ubiquitously today in the extraction of compounds from solid products, such as cannabis. Although many solvent choices are possible, ethanol’s strong ability to extract cannabinoids and terpenes, combined with its tolerability and safety for consumption, make it an ideal solvent for the microbrew Soxhlet extraction. Please reference the [figure](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Soxhlet_extractor.svg/800px-Soxhlet_extractor.svg.png) below, and follow along with our bolded, bracketed numbers (i.e. **[1]**), as we walk you through the extraction process.

The way a Soxhlet extraction works is quite ingenious. First, a porous plug that won’t dissolve in the solvent (usually sterile cotton fiber) is placed at the bottom of the thimble **[4]**. This prevents solid components from being carried along, allowing for the desired separation of compounds. Cannabis flower is then loaded into the thimble on top of the first plug and packed fairly tight—the technique works best if the flower is ground beforehand, homogenizing the size of the particles and maximizing penetration of solvent into the plant. Then, cap the flower with a second porous plug to a depth of about 1”, depending on the size of your glassware. An alternative packing method is to prepare small volumes of homogenized flower in individual bags with appropriately small pores to contain the solid products, and pack these bags from the bottom of the thimble to the top.

![img](https://extractionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/800px-Soxhlet_extractor.svg_-518x1024.png)

A condenser **[9]** is added to the setup, with cold water flowing in from the bottom **[11]** and out from the top **[10]**, the counter-current maximizing thermal exchange at the point closest to the Soxhlet glassware, reducing condensation time. Then, 95% ethanol (or higher) is added to the still pot **[2]**. A recent paper examining the THC content in nutritional hemp seeds described a Soxhlet extraction using 100-150 mL of ethanol for every gram of solid matrix.*2*

When the steps above are completed, a magnetic stirrer **[1]** is added to the still pot to evenly distribute heat and to avoid splashing bubble formation. Then, the still is lowered onto a specially-designed round-bottom heating mantle, which can also control the rate of stirring of the magnet. An example of what such a heating mantle looks like can be seen in the [image](https://assets.wn.com/wiki/en/e/71/-Soxhlet_siphoning.we-4a1fdb.jpg) below.

![img](https://extractionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Soxhlet_siphoning.we-4a1fdb.jpg)

The ethanol is heated until reaching [reflux](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Organic_Chemistry/Book%3A_Organic_Chemistry_Lab_Techniques_(Nichols)/1%3A_General_Techniques/1.3%3A_Heating_and_Cooling_Methods/1.3K%3A_Reflux), a steady-state of evaporation-condensation. When the heated ethanol reaches its boiling point, entering the gas phase, it travels up the distillation arm **[3]** until reaching the condenser, where it liquifies due to the cold temperature of the condenser walls. The liquid ethanol drips directly onto the thimble, enveloping and extracting any soluble components from the cannabis plant.

The key moment that makes the Soxhlet extraction special happens when enough ethanol has condensed so that the volume of liquid in the thimble reaches the height of the siphon top **[6]**. At that point, the physics behind [siphon mechanics](http://www.physicscentral.com/experiment/askaphysicist/physics-answer.cfm?uid=20080512104921) cause all the liquid in the thimble to drain through the siphon exit **[7]** and back into the still pot, leaving a thimble empty of liquid behind. Put all this together by [following this link](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Soxhlet_mechanism.gif) to see a crude animation of a working Soxhlet extractor.

Each cycle of solvation-extraction removes progressively more soluble compounds, and the more cycles that are allowed to occur, the more complete the extraction becomes. The aforementioned study on THC in hemp seeds described leaving the Soxhlet extraction under reflux for four hours.*2*

The main advantages of the Soxhlet technique is that one can achieve a very thorough full-spectrum extract with minimal loss of solvent, and without hands-on engagement with the equipment during the extraction phase. Key disadvantages are lower efficiency in the sense of the relatively long time the technique requires to extract from a relatively small amount of cannabis, and the accumulation of plant components soluble in ethanol, like chlorophyll, which affect extract taste and texture. The relatively higher temperature of this technique may also lead to some thermal degradation of desired products. And it’s important to note that, as with any solvent-based extraction, some amount of post-processing will need to occur, the exact processes depending on the final product in mind.

We are, however, optimistic. While this technique does not allow for scale-up, it provides a means for a culture of micro-brewed extracts to grow, similar to that seen in the beer industry. If individuals and small businesses find the capability to create their own extracts on a financial and time scale appropriate for their wishes, and are allowed to do so by legislative support, we may find ourselves living in a time where friends share extracts they’ve made at home much like they share home-brewed beers, with all the pride and joy that comes along with it. The Soxhlet extraction provides a feasible possibility for this to occur, with a relatively small investment in equipment, expertise, and time.

Cannabidiol (CBD) is the chemical compound within the hemp plant whose therapeutic properties have caused a stir in different industries in recent years. From pharmaceutical companies to cosmetic giants, everyone seems to be coming up with some form of CBD oil, CBD cream, or CBD ointment.

If you’re looking to incorporate products that contain CBD oil into your business, buying readily processed CBD oil may be expensive in the long run, when compared to buying hemp flowers, stalk, and stems for industrial hemp extraction within your facility. To save money, you’ll need to invest in the right industrial hemp extraction equipment.

If you’re looking to get into [the hemp industry](https://whatishemp.com/industrial-hemp/), here’s everything you need to know.

![industrial hemp extraction equipment](https://833192.smushcdn.com/1281688/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/industrial-hemp-extraction-equipment_Inset-1024x574-1.jpg?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1)

## 4 Types of Industrial Hemp Extraction Systems

Also known as hemp extract, [CBD oil](https://whatishemp.com/buy-cbd-hemp-oil/) is extracted from the hemp plant using a variety of methods and equipment. These extraction systems differ mostly in terms of the solvents they use in the extraction process. Common methods used to extract CBD from hemp include carbon dioxide extraction, alcohol extraction, butane extraction, and ice water extraction.

### 1. Carbon Dioxide Extraction Systems

Carbon dioxide hemp extraction is known to produce higher CBD oil yields compared to the other solvents on the list. This is majorly attributed to the capability of the extraction machines to exert high amounts of heat and pressure on the carbon dioxide gas, forcing an increase in extraction efficiency. These systems have several advantages including:

- They help minimize wastage by producing massive yields without compromising on purity
- You can use it to extract specific chemical components found within the hemp plant
- CBD oil extracted using this method is safe for consumption since the carbon dioxide gas trapped in it usually evaporates away quite easily
- Carbon dioxide gas is a relatively cheaper solvent compared to alcohol and butane

The single major downside to using carbon dioxide extraction machines is that they’re relatively slow when compared to others on this list.

### 2. Alcohol-Based Extraction Systems

These systems use alcohol (like ethanol) as the main solvent. The ethanol soaks up the chemical compounds from the hemp plant, including the targeted CBD oil. The CBD is then separated from the rest of the compounds through evaporation.

The main advantage of [alcohol-based CBD oil extraction](https://thebossmagazine.com/ethanol-extraction-cbd/) is that ethanol is cheap and easy to source. Additionally, it doesn’t leave behind any toxic contaminants in the final product thanks to the efficient evaporation process of the alcohol.

On the flipside, ethanol is highly inflammable and any major variations in temperature during the extraction process can significantly compromise the quality of the extract. What’s more, further processing has to be done on the CBD oil to remove the chlorophyll which has an unpleasant smell.

### 3. Butane Cannabis Extraction Systems

Also known as hydrocarbon extraction systems, butane systems work much like the carbon dioxide extraction systems. The only difference is that the butane solvent has to be heated and pressurized to turn it into gas. This then makes it easier to remove the butane from the final product.

Some of these systems use a mixture of butane and propane gas. One advantage of using a butane extractor is that its hemp extract comes with a distinct, aromatic flavor.

However, the hydrocarbon extraction usually leaves behind a residual called butane shatter or [butane hash oil](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6220730/) – which is a controlled substance. Additionally, since butane is highly flammable, you’ll have to ensure you maintain the appropriate temperatures during the CBD oil extraction process to prevent an explosion.

### 4. Ice Water Extraction Systems

These systems feature an ice water extraction chamber where you place your hemp flowers and give them a “cold bath” to remove the denser THC. The CBD-rich water is then filtered to get the hemp extract.

This basic technique is perfect for small-scale cannabis oil extraction. For bulk extraction, the previous methods and equipment are recommended.

## 4 Important Things to Consider in a Hemp Oil Extraction Machine

To get the high-quality consumable hemp oil and other concentrates, you need to use the right extraction machine – depending on your needs. Before you choose the first extraction system you come across, consider the following:

### 1. Size of the Machine

Hemp extraction machines vary by size, mostly depending on the design preferences of the brands that make them. Some can take up a whole room, while others are as small as a kettle. Therefore, consider the amount of available space you have before getting the extractor. 

### 2. Processing Speeds

The rate at which CBD oil is extracted from the hemp plant varies depending on the machine’s efficiency. For instance, powerful industrial extraction machines can process even up to 22 liters of hemp oil within two hours. Unfortunately, these systems are some of the most expensive in the market. If you’re working on a tight budget and wouldn’t mind the processing speeds, then you’re better off with a slower extraction system.

### 3. Mode of Operation

Depending on what you prefer, some machines support solvent-based extraction while others don’t. Common solutions used in solvent-based extractors include carbon dioxide (CO2), propane, and alcohol. Before investing in a hemp extractor, consider the availability of a particular solvent in your area.

### 4. Quality Certifications

Since CBD oil qualifies as a consumable product, its processing regulations are developed and enforced by the [Food and Drugs Administration](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd) (FDA) which is responsible for ensuring food safety and quality standards are maintained in the manufacturing of food products. Therefore, ensure your CBD oil extraction system is approved by the necessary regulatory bodies, especially if you’re running a business.

### Get Quality Extracts with the Right Industrial Hemp Extraction Equipment

If your business can’t purchase an industrial hemp extraction equipment right away, you can always lease one to allow you to get off the ground without making huge capital investments. This will also help you test out different types of hemp extraction systems and help you find the best one for your business.

As the hemp industry grows, we can expect advancements in all extraction processes for high-quality hemp extracts and concentrates.

As the popularity of CBD grows more and more among people searching for holistic treatments for several ailments, the number of brands producing CBD oil and tinctures also grows fast. However, many people are choosing to prepare their own oil to have more control over the product quality, price, and especially the potency of the oil. You must be thinking: *how to make my own CBD oil*? There are two ways to prepare it, the oil and the alcohol method, and both bring all of the [hemp benefits](https://whatishemp.com/#benefits) that you’re looking for.

When making any oil from cannabis, what you want to do is extract the cannabinoids and terpenes from the plant and get a concentrated extract to be used for vaping or ingesting. The crucial quality difference lies in the quality of the cannabis strain. Read on to learn more about *how to make CBD oil from hemp*.

## **How to make my own CBD oil – Choose the best strain**

To get the best oil possible, you will need to get the best ingredients. Thus, the first step of this process would be choosing a high-quality cannabis strain with the highest level of CBD possible. The best oil comes from the cannabis buds or flowers because this part of the plant contains the highest concentration of cannabinoids, but you can also get high amounts of CBD from the hemp leaves and flowers, which contain almost no THC. Industrial [hemp plants are legal](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/is-cbd-legal-heres-what-you-need-to-know-according-to-science) in most of the United States, various countries around Europe and throughout the world, which makes it easier to find them to make CBD oil. Learn more about the [state of hemp legalization worldwide](https://whatishemp.com/the-state-of-hemp-legalization-worldwide/).

Make sure to choose the cannabis plant from an organic and trustworthy source to ensure there’s nothing other than the cannabinoids and terpenes on the final product. For this method, you can use 30g of buds or an amount of 60g to 100g of the ground buds, dry shake, or trim. The technique is the same for extracting CBD or other cannabinoids such as THC, and the only difference lies in the strain you choose.

![img](https://833192.smushcdn.com/1281688/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_681136063-min-1024x684.jpg?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1)*You can have your own homemade CBD oil full of cannabinoids and terpenes*

*.*If your goal is to use the oil to ingest, you must decarboxylate the plant before following the next steps, but if you’re planning to use it for vape, there’s no need to do this process. If you are not sure *how to make CBD vape oil*, please note that the [decarboxylation process](https://themarijuanafacts.com/decarboxylation/) helps the cannabinoic acids be converted into cannabinoids that our body accepts, which makes the vaping experience better. To make the decarboxylation process, you must bake the plant for about 90 minutes at a temperature of 100ºC to 110ºC (210ºF to 230ºF).

### ***How to make CBD vape oil\* or edible oil – Alcohol method**

For the alcohol method, you can use either ethanol or grain alcohol, but these need to be cold, contain at least 60% of alcohol, and be food-safe. Ground or separate the buds and use enough alcohol to cover the plant in a glass container, then mix it gently with a plastic or wooden spoon. You must leave it for no longer than 3 minutes, and this process must be very fast to ensure you’re only getting what you want from the cannabis plant. Then, separate the plant from the liquid using a fine strainer and repeat this process to extract the resin until the alcohol comes out clear.

The process entails using a [double boiler](https://bloom-hemp.com/how-to-infuse-cbd-a-complete-guide-to-the-double-boiling-method/), a rice cooker, or a water distiller, but it is not advised to do this without prior experience because the vapors that come out of the boiling are highly flammable, and there’s a high fire risk. Make sure to do this in an open area or somewhere with free ventilation and avoid breathing the vapors that come out of the boiling process. If you’re not using a water distiller, keep the temperature around 70ºC for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring the mixture until it decreases in volume, becomes extremely viscous, and forms no more bubbles.

To keep removing the alcohol, you can put this mixture into a smaller bowl and place it over the heater of a coffee machine for 24 hours. This process will make the alcohol evaporate, leaving behind just the oil. To test if there’s any alcohol left, insert the tip of a paper clip to the oil, remove it and use a lighter to light it, if it sparks, there’s still alcohol present. After all the alcohol is removed, you’ll get an extract with a thick consistency, and you can put it while still warm into syringes, which will make it easier to administer and store it.

![This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is shutterstock_1425201758-min-1024x683.jpg](https://833192.smushcdn.com/1281688/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_1425201758-min-1024x683.jpg?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1)*You’ll get a CBD oil extract with a thick consistency that can be put into a syringe.*

### ***How to make CBD oil from hemp\* – Oil method**

The oil method is beneficial for having an extract that can be digested, but you must also do the decarboxylation process explained below before the extraction if you want an edible extract. For this method, you will need to choose a carrier oil, and you can pick your favorite one, such as olive or coconut oil, cold-pressed, and organic. You’ll need a fine strainer, such as cheesecloth or a coffee filter, non-stick paper, and a baking tray.

First, spread all the cannabis evenly into the non-stick paper over a baking tray with a fine layer. The decarboxylation process can also be done using the oven. Heat the oven to 120ºC (255ºF) and put the cannabis to bake for about 45 minutes to one hour to decarboxylate the plant material.

After this process, boil water in a large pan, creating a double boiler for a water bath with a metal or glass bowl over it as this will heat the oil through the water vapor. Add the decarboxylated cannabis to the oil and keep mixing it. Use a kitchen thermometer to keep the oil at 105ºC (220ºF), letting it sit for about 3 hours, stirring a bit every half an hour, and making sure the water doesn’t evaporate completely. Turn off the heat, let the mixture sit for 3 hours, and then repeat the double boiling process for another 3 hours.

Leave the buds and oil mixture to sit for the night, and the next morning, strain the oil using the cheesecloth or coffee filter. Your CBD oil is then ready to use, and the concentration will depend on the amount of buds you soaked into the oil and its CBD ratio. You can use this oil for either vaping or ingesting, but it will be less concentrated than the oil extracted using the alcohol method. The remaining strained plants from this process do not contain any cannabinoids and can be thrown away or used for compost.

Now that you’ve learned more about *how to make CBD oil from hemp*, these two methods make it easier to extract your own CBD oil at home for vaping or ingesting. Make sure to follow these instructions thoroughly and use the suggested ingredients and equipment. It is highly advised to consult with a trusted health professional before using any sort of cannabis oil, especially if you are going through medical treatments. A physician with experience prescribing CBD treatments may know what the advised dosage should be and how these oils can interact with other therapies you’re undergoing.

# Ice Water Hash Extraction – How to Do It at Home

- September 12, 2019
- 5:11 pm

*Ice water hash extraction is a simple, clean, non-volatile process for making hash from trim.* 

Anyone who cultivates cannabis will often have quantities of trim – trimmed plant material – which it is often difficult to know what to do with.

Ice water extraction is a process for turning that potential waste product into something very useful indeed…

## What is ice water hash extraction?

Ice water extraction is the name given to a process of removing cannabis trichomes (which contain THC) from the raw plant material. It also sometimes goes by the name of full melt, water hash or bubble hash. The reason why the process is called “ice water hash extraction” is because of the fact that the only solvent used is ice cold water. The chilly water makes the resin very brittle so it can be separated from the plant nice and easily.

Because there are no chemicals involved, the resultant hash tends to be purer and more “natural” tasting than most alternatives. This is because the cannabis-derived terpenes (the organic compounds found in many plants and which give different marijuana strains their distinctive aromas and flavors) have not been exposed to heat, which can cause them to be damaged or break down.

*Ice water extraction also gives you the perfect solution to the question of what to do with weed trim which would otherwise be wasted.*

## Making Hash from Trim – How to Make Ice Water Hash

Here is a very simple method for making ice water hash. It’s possible to do this with the kind of equipment most people will have lying around their kitchen.

Here’s how it works:

1. ### Gather your trimmings

2. When you trim your plants, gather together all of the trimmings and let them dry.
   To ensure they are fully dried, before you start the ice water hash extraction process, put them in the freezer for about 30 minutes.

3. ### Gather your equipment

4. To make ice water hash at home, you will need:

5. - Two bowls or pans large enough to contain all of your trimmings and some water
   - One strainer or colander
   - One ladle
   - One metal coffee filter (or any reusable type)
   - Some paper coffee filters
   - One electric mixer or a whisk or wooden spoon
   - Ice (approximately two trays of ice per ounce of trim you are using)

6. Be sure not to get your ice out of your freezer until you’re ready to get started!

7. ### Make soup

8. Now it’s time to get the process started.

9. Place all of your trim and all of your ice into one of the bowls. Then add a little water – just enough to turn it to a soup-like consistency.

10. Don’t go overboard on the water here – you are only going to have to extract it at the end – but you will need some for the process to work.

11. ### Hand mix

12. Gently swirl your trim, ice and water together so that everything is nicely mixed and no dry bits of trim remain.

13. Using your hands is probably best, but you might want to wear gloves…

14. This is ice water, remember.

15. ### Serious mix

16. If you have an electric mixer, you are going to be very happy with this stage. If not, it is going to take a little bit of work on your part!

17. For the next 10-15 minutes, mix your trim and ice water together.

18. There is a chance that some bubbling may occur. This is normal.

19. ![hand holding a glass ball over water](https://kindconcentrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/hand-holding-a-glass-ball.jpg)

20. ### Let it set

21. After mixing, your trim and ice-water concoction should look more like soup than ever.

22. Let it set for about 40 minutes, topping up on ice if the temperature in your preparation area is too hot.

23. ### Strain

24. Take your second bowl or pan and place the strainer or colander over the top.

25. Now, using your ladle, slowly scoop the mixture into the strainer, allowing the liquid to flow through into the bowl beneath.

26. The leaves left in the strainer should be squeezed out into the strainer to ensure as much liquid as possible has been excreted.

27. The liquid in your bowl should be a green-yellow color. There may be the occasional bit of trim floating in it where the strainer wasn’t quite fine enough. That’s not a problem.

28. ### Set aside

29. You can now set aside those leaves in the strainer – they may be suitable for making another entire batch of ice water hash!

30. ### Fine strain

31. You should now have one bowl of green-yellow liquid and one empty bowl which used to have your ice water mixture in.

32. You’re now going to strain the green-yellow liquid into the other bowl again.

33. This time, you’re going to use your reusable coffee filter to strain more finely.

34. Hold your reusable coffee filter over the now empty bowl and use your ladle to strain through the liquid.

35. Depending on how much trim you have and how much water you used, this may take some time.

36. ### Final strain

37. The final strain involves passing the liquid back to the other bowl through another filter. This time, the finest one you have – your paper coffee filter.

38. Place the paper coffee filter in your reusable coffee filter and hold it over the other bowl. Again using the ladle, pour the liquid through the filter.

39. As you approach the end of the water in your bowl, you should see little bits of sediment start to form in the paper coffee filter.

40. That is your hash.

41. ### Gently squeeze and dry

42. After you have passed all of the water through, gently – very gently – squeeze out any liquid remaining in the coffee filter.

43. Then you can place the paper coffee filter into a dry one to help it dry out faster. This will also serve to prevent your wet filter coming apart in your hands.

44. After leaving your hash to dry for a while, it is ready to use.

Your ice water hash extraction process is complete.
