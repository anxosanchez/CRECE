# Moodle Quewstion bank

Questions in Moodle are organized into categories. A new course starts out with one category named "Default for [course name]." To make it easier to find questions, and to facilitate the use of random questions, organize your questions into additional categories. You can create a hierarchy of categories by creating subcategories inside parent categories. The more organized you make your question categories during the initial setup of your course, the easier it will be to reuse questions in future quizzes and exams.
