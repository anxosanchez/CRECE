   abstract = {Several physicochemical parameters must be determined in order to verify the quality of commercial biodiesel, and the analysis of total fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) is the main parameter. Therefore, an efficient and alternative analytical method using gas chromatography coupled with ultrafast module is important. This method was developed to quantify FAMEs in biodiesel commercial samples that originated from different feedstock (babaçu, coconut, rapeseed, corn, soybean, animal/palm oil and sunflower). The chromatographic run time is 90 s. When compared with the official methods, we had a much faster one, which provided an analytical frequency of up to 205 samples a day. This analytical method has been validated according to in-house validation parameters, such as linearity, repeatability, reproducibility (intermediate precision) and accuracy. Two analytical curves were prepared, one for determinate long carbon chain FAMEs (C16–C24) and another for short carbon chain FAMEs (C6–C14). The coefficient of determination (which represents the percentage of the data that is closest to the line of best fit) was 0.9992 for the C18 curve (long chain) and the C12 curve (short chain). Repeatability and reproducibility presented a relative standard deviation of 0.75% and 1.68% for the C18 curve and 0.44% and 1.05% for the C12 curve, respectively. The accuracy had a standard error of 0.2 for soybean biodiesel, 0.4 for animal/palm commercial biodiesel and 0.2 for babaçu biodiesel.},

This first level is based on properties and characteristics of solvents for their selection. Different tools are integrated into the program to aid the evaluation of the group of solvents selected. A case study is presented to highlight the most important aspects of the methodology.

Different fatty acids employed for various metathesis reactions were oleic, linoleic, linolenic, eicosenoic, erucic, petroselinic, sterculic, undecenoic and ricinoleic acids, while vegetable oils used were Helianthus (sunflower), Brassica napus (rapeseed), Glycine max (soybean), Hevea brasiliensis (rubber), Butea monosperma (palash), Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) and Sterculia foetida (jangli badam). Even though Grubbs’ catalysts were employed for most of the reactions, other catalysts such as rhenium, molybdenum and tungsten based have also been used for selective reactions of vegetable oils and fatty acids. The article reviews some of the mechanistic pathways involved in the generation of unusual intermediates from fatty acids and triglycerides. Graphical Abstract : Various olefin metathesis reactions namely self-metathesis (SM), crossmetathesis (CM), acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) polymerization, ring closing metathesis (RCM) and ring opening metathesis (ROM) reactions for the synthesis of a variety of platform chemicals with potential industrial applications from vegetable oils and fatty acids are discussed in this article.},
